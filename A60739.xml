            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Subject of the enſueing work is the Art of Painting: a name not only too ſingular; but alſo too ſhort or narrow, to expreſs what is here intended thereby: For we do not only expreſs that Art, (as it is generally received) but alſo <hi>Drawing, Engraving, Etching, Limning, Waſhing, Colouring</hi> and <hi>Dying;</hi> all which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in their peoper extent, infinitely exceed that curtail'd name of <hi>Painting;</hi> which that we might join all in one proper and comprehenſive word, we made choice of that Greek Compound <hi>POLYGRAPHICE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To perſwade any one to the ſtudy or practice of this Art, would be a great folly; ſince <hi>Ignorance</hi> (which is always blind) can never be able to judge aright: For to him that already underſtands it, the labour would be uſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable; to him which is already delighted therein, it would be needleſs and ſuperflu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us; and to the Averſe and Ignorant, it would be the putting a Jewel into a Swines ſnout: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite knowledge of which is impoſſible ever to be attained
<pb facs="tcp:100848:5"/>or underſtood, by ſuch prejudicate and cloudy Souls, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is ſufficiently known to many already; and its uſefulneſs as apparent as it is excellent: To enumerate the one, or rehearſe the other, is but to perſwade the world, that <hi>it is day-light when the Sun is upon the Meridian;</hi> or at leaſt to inculcate, <hi>an ignorance of thoſe things,</hi> which have been <hi>manifeſtly known</hi> even a long time ſince.</p>
            <p>The Method of this work is wholly new, wherein we have united and made one, ſuch various ſubjects, as have been the uncertain, obſcure and tedious diſcourſe of a great number of various and large Volumes. <hi>What ſhall we ſay?</hi> things far aſunder, <hi>we have laid together:</hi> things uncertain, <hi>are here limited and reduced:</hi> things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, <hi>we have made plain:</hi> things tedious, <hi>we have made ſhort:</hi> things erroneous, <hi>we have rectified and corrected:</hi> things hard, <hi>we have made facil and eaſie:</hi> things various, <hi>we have collected:</hi> things (in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) heterogene, <hi>we have made homogene:</hi> And in in a word, the whole Art <hi>we have reduced to certain heads;</hi> brought under <hi>a certain method;</hi> limited to <hi>practical rules;</hi> and made it <hi>perſpicuous,</hi> even to a very mean underſtanding.</p>
            <p>In the Compoſure of this work (beſides our own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations) we have made uſe of the beſt Authors now Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, that we could poſſibly procure, or get into our hands; wherein our labour was not ſmall; what in <hi>Reading, Comparing, Tranſcribing, Chooſing, Correcting, Diſpoſing,</hi> and <hi>Reviſing</hi> every thing, in reſpect of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Form,</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> The which had we any <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> to have followed; any <hi>Path</hi> to have traced; any <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to have imitated; any <hi>Help</hi> to have conſulted; or any <hi>Subject</hi> entire: Or otherwiſe, had the <hi>Number</hi> of our Authors been ſmall; their <hi>Maxims,</hi> truths; their <hi>Rules,</hi> certain; their <hi>Meanings</hi> not obſcure; or their <hi>Precepts</hi> been reduced to Method and Order: We might not only,

            <p>In this ſecond Edition we have not only inſerted ſeveral <hi>Copper Cuts,</hi> with more than <hi>two hundred</hi> ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of ſingular uſe, through the three firſt books; but there is alſo a whole fourth book, containing above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Chapters of ſuch neceſſary matter, that the work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them may really be accounted <hi>defective.</hi> 'Tis true, ſome things are not only immethodically diſpoſed (by reaſon this latter part was not intended at the reprinting hereof till afterwards, upon more mature and deliberate conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) but alſo much out of Order; yet we thought better to have them <hi>out of Order,</hi> than <hi>out of the Book.</hi> There is not only ſeveral neceſſary things added (which were omitted in the three firſt books;) as alſo the various depicturings of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, according to the cuſtom of every nation, drawn from the beſt, moſt experienced and faithfulleſt Authors now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, (whether <hi>Engliſh, Italian</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi>) but alſo the various ways of Painting, Beautifying and Adorning the Face and Skin, ſo artificially, as it ſhall be imperceptible to the ſcrutiny of the moſt curious and piercing eye: to which we have added (as a neceſſary Appendice) <hi>the whole doctrine of Perſumes,</hi> never written on (to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) in this order before; together with the <hi>Original, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of theſe Arts.</p>
            <p>Loſtly, the Reader is deſired to take notice, that in this following work, there are many excellent ſecrets, not vulgarly known, which fell into our hands from ſeveral ſpecial friends, (whoſe exquiſite knowledge in theſe kinds of Myſteries doth truly declare them to be abſolute Maſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) which for the publick good are freely communicated to the world.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THe <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of Drawing are ſevenfold, <hi>viz.</hi> Charcoals, feathers of a Ducks-wing, black and red Lead pencils, pens made of Ravens quils, Rulers, Compaſſes, and Paſtils.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Charcoals</hi> are to be choſen of Sallow-wood ſplit into the form of pencils, and ſharpened to a point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly known by their pith in the middle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their uſe is to draw lightly the draught over at firſt, that if any thing he drawn amiſs it may be wiped out and amended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>feathers</hi> ought to be of a Ducks-wing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100848:7"/>(though others may ſerve well enough) with which you may wipe out any ſtroak of the Charcoal where it is drawn amiſs, leſt variety of Lines breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Black andred Lead pencils,</hi> are to go over your draught the ſecond time more exactly, becauſe this will not wipe out with your hand, when you come to draw it over with the pen.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Pens</hi> made of Ravens quills (but others may ſerve) are to finiſh the work: but herein you muſt be very careful and exact, for what is now done amiſs there is no altering of.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Rulers,</hi> which are of uſe to draw ſtraight or perpendicular lines, triangles, ſquares or poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, the which you are to uſe in the beginning, till practice and experience may render them needleſs.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Compaſſes</hi> made of fine Braſs with Steel points, to take in and out, that you may uſe black or red Lead at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their uſe is firſt to meaſure (by help of a curious ſcale of equal parts upon the edge of your Ruler) your proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and whether your work is exact which is done with the Charcoal. Secondly, to draw Circles, Ovals, and Arches withal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Paſtils</hi> are made of ſeveral Colours to draw withal, upon coloured paper or parchment, Thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take Plaiſter of Paris or Alabaſter calcined, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of which you intend to make your paſtils with,</hi> ana q. ſ. <hi>grind them firſt aſunder, then together, and with a little water make them into paſte, then with your hands roul them into long pieces like black-lead pencils, then drie them moderately in the Air: being dryed, when you uſe them, ſcrape them to a point like an ordinary pencil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus may you make paſtils of what colour you pleaſe, fitting them for the <hi>faces of Men or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

                  <hi>Thoſe that deſire to be furniſhed with any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Patterns, Copies or Prints, may have of all ſorts, whether of Humane ſhape, Perſpective deſign, Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip, Fowls, Beaſts, Fiſhes, Inſects, Plants, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or any other Artificial figures, exquiſitely drawn, at very reaſonable rates, where this Book is to be ſold.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. BE ſure to have all the neceſſaries aforeſaid in readineſs, but it will be good to practiſe as much as may be without the help of your Rule and Compaſſes; it is your eye and fanſie muſt judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out artificial meaſurings.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Then firſt begin with plain Geometrical figures,</hi> as Lines, Angles, Triangles, Quadrangles, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, Arches, Circles, Ovals, Cones, Cylinders and the like. For theſe are the foundations of all other proportions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Circle</hi> helps in all orbicular forms, as in the Sun, Moon, &amp;c. the <hi>Oval</hi> in giving a juſt proportion to the face and mouth; the mouth of a Pot or Well, the foot of a Glaſs, &amp;c. the <hi>Square</hi> confines the Picture
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100848:8"/>you are to Copy, &amp;c. the <hi>Triangle</hi> in the half-face; the <hi>Polygone</hi> in Ground-plats, Fortifications, and the like; <hi>Angles</hi> and <hi>Arches</hi> in Perſpective; the <hi>Cone</hi> in Spires-tops of Towers and Steeples: the <hi>Cylinder</hi> in Columns, Pillars, Pilaſters, and their Ornaments.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Having made your hand fit and ready in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral proportions, then learn to give every object its due ſhade according to its convexity or concavity, and to elevate or depreſs the ſame, as the object ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears either nearer or farther off the light, the which is indeed the life of the work.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>The ſecond practice of drawing</hi> conſiſts in forming <hi>fruits,</hi> as Apples, Pears, Cherries, Peaches, Grapes, Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, Peaſcods, &amp;c. with their <hi>leaves:</hi> the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>flowers,</hi> as Roſes, Tulips, Carnations, &amp;c. <hi>Herbs,</hi> as Roſemary, Tyme, Hyſop, &amp;c. <hi>Trees,</hi> as the Oak Fir, Aſh, Wallnut, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>The third practice of Drawing imitates,</hi> 1. <hi>Beaſts,</hi> as the Lamb, Elephant, Lion, Bear, Leopard, Dog, Cat, Buck, Unicorn, Horſe, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Fowls,</hi> as the Eagle, Swan, Parrot, Partridge, Dove, Raven, &amp;c. 3. <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> as the Whale, Herring, Pike, Carp, Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, Lobſter, Crab, &amp;c. <hi>of which, variety of Prints may be bought at reaſonable rates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>The fourth praxis imitates</hi> the body of Man with all its Lineaments, the Head, Noſe, Eyes, Ears, Cheeks, hands, Arms, and ſhadows all exactly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional both to the whole, and one to another, as well to ſituation as Magnitude.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>The fifth praxis is in</hi> Drapery, imitating Cloathing, and Artificially ſetting off the outward Coverings, Habit and Ornaments of the Body, as Cloth, Stuff, Silk and Linnen, their natural and proper folds; which although it may ſeem ſomething hard to do, yet by much exerciſe and imitation of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100848:9"/>choiceſt Prints, will become facil and eaſie.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. In drawing of all the aforegoing forms, or what ever elſe, you muſt be perfect, firſt in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act proportions: ſecondly in the general or outward lines, before you fall to ſhadowing or trimming your work within.</p>
               <p n="10">X. In mixed and uncertain forms, where Circle and Square will do no good (but only the <hi>Idea</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in your own fanſie) as in Lions, Horſes, and the like; you muſt work by reaſon in your own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo obtain the true proportion by daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. <hi>Thus;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having the ſhape of the thing in your mind, firſt draw it rudely with your coal, then more exactly with your lead or pencil; then peruſe it well, and conſider where you have erred, and mend it, according to that</hi> Idea, <hi>which you carry in your mind; this done, view it again, correcting by degrees the other parts, even to the leaſt</hi> Jota, <hi>ſo far as your judgment will inform you; and this you may do with twenty, thirty, forty or more papers of ſeveral things at once: having done what you can, confer it with ſome excellent pattern or print of like kind, uſing no rule or compaſs at all, but your own reaſon, in mending every fault, giving every thing its due place, and juſt proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by this means you may rectifie all your errors, and ſtep an Incredible way on to perfection.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. IN drawing of the face you are firſt to obſerve its motion whether upwards, downwards, forwards, or ſideways; whether it be long or round, fat or lean, great or little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if it be fat, the cheeks will ſeem to ſwell: if lean, the jaw-bones will ſtick out, and the cheeks fall in; but if neither too fat nor too lean, it will be for the moſt part round.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Touch lightly the features where the eyes, mouth, noſe, and chin ſhould ſtand, (having firſt drawn the circle or oval of the face) then make a ſtroak down from that place of the forehead which is eaven with the Chin, coming down where you ſhould place the middle or tip of the noſe, and middle of the mouth, which ſtroak muſt be made ſtraight down in a full right face, but arched or oval in an oblique face, leaning that way towards which the face doth turn: then croſs the ſtroak about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Eyes, either with a ſtraight line in a right face, or with a Curved either upwards or downwards according to the preſent action or poſture of the face: then make another anſwerable to that, where the end of the noſe ſhould come; and another for the mouth, that it be not made crooked.</p>

               <p n="3">III. Then if the face look upwards toward hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or downwards towards the earth, let the Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, and Brows look accordingly with it; and now proceed to the placing of the features.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. In a juſt proportioned face, the diſtances, 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the top of the forehead and the eye-brows, 2. between the eye-brows and the bottom of the noſe, 3. between the bottom of the noſe and the bottom of the Chin, are equal.</p>
               <p n="5">V. In drawing the utmoſt Circumference of a face, take in the head and all with it, leſt you be deceived in drawing the true big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100848:11"/>
               <p n="6">VI. Then conſider all thoſe chief touches which give life to a face, adding grace thereto, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſcovering the diſpoſition of the mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So the mouth extended and the corners a little turning up, ſhews a ſmiling countenance: the eye-brow bending, and the forehead and top of the noſe between the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows wrinkled, ſhews one frowning: the upper eye-lid coming ſomething over the ball of the eye, ſhews one ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ſtayed: with many other touches which give life and ſpirit to a face, which in good paints, by little and little, and diligent obſervation you will at laſt find out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. The diſtances between the eyes, is the length of one eye in a full face, but in a three-quarted or half-face, it is leſſened proportionably: and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underneath the corners of the eyes, place the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Having given touches where the eyes, noſe, mouth and chin ſhould be placed, begin to draw them more exactly, and ſo proceed till the face be finiſhed; and then make the hair, beard, ſhadows, and other things about it.</p>

               <p n="9">IX. Be ſure to make the ſhadows rightly, and be ſure not to make them too dark, where they ſhould be faint; for that can never be made light again, and ſo the whole face is marr'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſhadows are fainter and lighter in a fair face than in a ſwarthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. When you have finiſhed the face, give here and there ſome hard touches with your pen where the ſhadows are darkeſt; then come the ears and hair, wherein, having drawn the out-line, draw the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal curls, or maſter ſtroaks in the hair, which will be a guide to you in the leſſer curls, whoſe dependance are on them: always make the curls to bend exactly according to the pattern, that they may lie looſe, or careleſly, and not as if they were ſtiff and forced; the curls being rightly drawn, in the laſt place ſtrike in the looſe hairs which hang ſcatteringly out of the Circles.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. In forming the Ear, deſcribe an Oval as it were, and proceeding lightly, joyn ſtroak to ſtroak, in ſuch manner as you ſee in the Figures; ſo that the ear may be entirely formed, without digreſſing from the bounds of Nature or Art.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Laſtly, having practiſed a little by rule, and brought your hand in; in drawing of any thing, firſt ſtrike the out-ſtroaks, principal veins, and muſcles lightly, and afterwards ſhadow them, ever following exquiſite patterns and prints, which will both encreaſe your judgment, and bring command to your hand.</p>

               <p n="1">I. IN drawing the hands, draw not all the joints, veins or other things to appear plainly, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lightly and faintly, and ſtrike out the bigneſs of the hand, and the manner of its turning with faint touches, and not with hard ſtrokes; then that being done right, part the fingers according to the pattern with like faint ſtroaks; then mark that place where any of the fingers do ſtand out from the others, with a faint reſemblance: this done, proceed to draw it more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, making the bending of the joints, the wriſts and other principal things more exactly; and laſtly, go over with it again, drawing every ſmall bending or ſwelling of the fingers, nails, knuckles and veins, ſo many as do appear.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Learn by good prints the juſt proportions of the hands, with their equal diſtances; obſerving this rule, that according as it turns one way or another, to ſhorten proportionally as they appear to the eye.</p>

               <p n="1">I. FIrſt begin with the head, and be ſure to give it its juſt proportion, anſwerable to what you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the whole body ſhall be; then draw the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in their exact breadth; after them, the trunk of the body: beginning at the Arm-pits, and ſo draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to the Hips on both ſides, obſerving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al the exact breadth of the Waſte; Laſtly, draw the legs, arms and hands, exactly to your pattern.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But firſt draw with a coal, and that very lightly and faintly, drawing nothing perfect (that you may the eaſier mend it if it be amiſs) and then afterwards finiſh one thing after another as curiouſly as you can.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Let the parallel ſinews, muſcles, veins and joints, be placed oppoſite one to another in a ſtraight line (as ſhoulder to ſhoulder, hip to hip, knee to knee, &amp;c.) for which purpoſe draw ſtraight croſs lines to guide you therein; obſerving that which way ſoever the body turns or bows, theſe lines may anſwer accordingly.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. Let all perpendicular joynts, and parts alſo, be placed in a right line one under another (as they are in your pattern) for which end, draw a ſtraight line (if the body be ſtraight) from the throat through the middle of the breaſt and privities, to the feet, to which line draw all thoſe particular points parallels, that the body may not appear crooked or awry.</p>
               <p n="5">V. In bowings and bendings of the body, let the extuberance of the outward part be juſt equal to the compreſſion of the inward part: making all things of an equal proportion; that as oppoſite parts may be equal (as the arm to the arm, leg to leg, &amp;c.) ſo every part may be proportionable to each other, (as the hand not too big for the arm, nor the arm for the body, nor the body for the legs, &amp;c.) only with this difference, that (as the one part may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear fully to the eye, or the other may turn away either in part, or in whole, or be ſeen ſide-way) it be made ſo much leſs than the other, by ſo much as it turns away from the ſight.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. As you obſerve a juſt proportion in bigneſs, ſo alſo in length, that as every oppoſite part be of equal length, ſo that each part may not be too long one for another, but according to the propoſed magnitude: And in this caſe that if the body be a wry, or any ways hid, thoſe parts may ſhorten accordingly, to what is out of ſight.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, Obſerve the juſt diſtance of one thing from another, for by that means you will be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in your draught; and, in ſhort time, perfectly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate your pattern or nature.</p>

               <p n="1">I. IN drawing after the life, as there are variety of faces, ſo no certain Rules can be delivered for the ſame; yet the following precautions may be uſeful.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Draw out the head in an Oval, one fourth part for the hair; one fourth part for the forehead and brows; one fourth for the noſe; and the laſt for the mouth and chin.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Having drawn out the head, meaſure out eight times the length of the head (the head making one of the eight parts) and draw a ſtraight line from the top of the head to the ſole of the foot.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. One heads length from the chin is for the breaſt; the next eighth part reacheth to the navel; the fourth part to the privities; the fifth part to the middle of the thigh; the ſixth part to the lower part of the knee; the ſeventh to the ſmall of the leg; and the eighth part to the heel.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The muſcles you muſt obſerve to draw exactly as they are in the life: the breadth of the ſhoulders, is about two meaſures of the head: the breadth of the hips, two meaſures of the face: the arms ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, are juſt the length of the whole figure, the breaſts alſo accounted; but without the breaſts they are but ſix.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The arms hanging ſtraight down reach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſpan of the knee: the length of the hand is the juſt length of the face. See the two figures fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100848:17"/>
               <p n="7">VII. Obſerve firſt to draw the head exactly, and next, the ſhoulders in their juſt breadth: then draw the trunk of the Body, and the reſt as at the firſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſixth Chapter.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Be ſure to place the joints, ſinews, and muſcles in their natural places, and alſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, in reſpect of Magnitude, Similitude, and Parts: leſt it ſeem crooked and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THe ſhadows of the neck, in a child or young woman, are very fine, rare, and hard to be ſeen: In a man, the ſinews and veins are expreſſed by ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of the reſt of the neck, and leaving them white: the ſhoulder is ſhadowed underneath: the brawn of the arm muſt appear full and white, ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on one ſide.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The veins of the back of the hand, and the knuckles are made with two or three hair ſtroaks with a fine touch of the pen.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The paps of a man are ſhewed by two or three ſtroaks given underneath: in a woman with an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicular ſhade, ſomewhat deep; the ribs retain no ſhadow, except you repreſent one lean or ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:100848:19"/>
               <p n="4">IV. The belly is made eminent by ſhadowing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the breaſt bone and the flank: The brawn of the thigh is ſhadowed by drawing ſmall hair ſtroaks from the hip to the knee, and croſſed again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwartly.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The knee is to be finely ſhadowed underneath the joint; the ſhin-bone appears by ſhadowing one half of the leg with a ſingle ſhadow.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The ankle-bone appears by ſhadowing a little underneath (as in the knees) and the ſinews thereof muſt ſeem to take beginning from the midſt of the foot; and to wax bigger as they grow nearer to the toes.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, the ſhadows of the foot muſt take place according as reaſon and occaſion requires, for which (as alſo in all the former precepts) the having of good prints will be no ſmall advantage unto you.</p>

            <div n="9" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>The way and manner of Shadowing.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. IF it be a ſurface only it is beſt ſhadowed by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lines (either ſtraight or oblique, according as the ſuperficies is) through the better half thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If it be in a body, it is a double ſhadow, and is uſed when a ſuperficies begins to forſake your ſight, as in Columns and Pillars, where it is double dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and repreſenteth to the eye, as it were the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, leaving that unſhadowed to the light.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The treble ſhadow is made by croſſing over again the double ſhadow, and is uſed for the inward parts of things, as in clefts of the earth, wells, caves, the inſides of pots, cups and diſhes.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:100848:19"/>
               <p n="4">IV. In ſhadowing, let the ſhadow always fall one way, that is, on the ſame ſide of the body; leaving the other to the light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So in drawing a man, if I begin to ſhadow his right cheek, I muſt ſhadow the right part of his neck, arm, ſide, thigh, leg,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But if the light ſide of the body be darkned by the oppoſition of ſome other body ſtanding between the light and it, it muſt receive a contrary ſhadow according as the light is obfuſcated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So if threepillars ſtand together, that in the midſt muſt receive a ſhadow on both ſides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. All circular bodies muſt have a circular ſhadow (by the firſt Section of this Chapter) according to their form or appearance, and the orbicular ſhadow of the object which caſteth it.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Let your ſhadow grow fainter and fainter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatneſs of the diſtance from the opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Body ſhadowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the reaſon is, becauſe all ſhadows are pyramidal, in which caſe, ſpace of place prevails with the light againſt the ſhadow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII Where contrary ſhadows concurr, let the meaneſt and moſt ſolid body be firſt ſerved; and in double and treble ſhadows, let the firſt lines be very dry for fear of blotting, before you croſs them.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. All perfect lights receive no ſhadow at all; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſt, are only to be made apparent by that body which receives them; whoſe ſhadow muſt be according to the efflux of light: but the colour of the light ought to agree with the medium which receives it, whether it be Air, Cryſtal, Water, Amber, Glaſs, Tranſparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, or the like.</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>Fear</hi> is expreſſed by making the eyes look hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, heavie and downward, thin faln cheeks, cloſe mouth, and ſtaring careleſs hair about the ears.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Envie</hi> is beſt decyphred by the only hanging of the cheeks, and a pale countenance; and ſometimes by grinning of the teeth.</p>

               </figure>
               <p n="2">II. Thoſe parts of the body near to the Eye muſt be made greater and longer than thoſe farther off, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the eye judgeth ſo of them) and according to the diſtance from the eye, ſo muſt you vary from that which is otherwiſe the real true proportion of thoſe parts.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In foreſhortning you muſt take things as they appear to the eye, and not to draw the full proportion of each part, but to ſhorten all, according to the rate or reaſon which is obfuſcated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So if you would draw a ſhip foreright, there can appear but only her forepart (for the reſt being hid cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt:) the like of an horſe looking full in my face, or a man lying along; I muſt here of neceſſity foreſhorten, to expreſs the Viſual property: And in this caſe your eye and reaſon muſt be your chief guide to give the true reaſon and meaſure of theſe appearances, whether in Drawing, Limning or Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The uſe of this foreſhortning is to expreſs all manner of actions in man or beaſt; to repreſent many things in a little room; to ſhew at one view to the eye and mind, the whole body of a temple, with all its arches and pillars whether the inſide or outſide, as alſo the ſundry ſides of Cities, Caſtles and Forts, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That in every caſe you make Nature the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of all draughts, ſo that nothing be expreſt, but what doth agree and accord with nature; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be either forced beyond nature, nor yet any thing to come ſhort of nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As if in drawing the picture of a man, be ſure you draw not ſuch a poſturt as is impoſſible for him to imitate with his natural body.</hi>

               <p n="2">II. Suite your garments to the body, and make them bend with the body, according as it ſtands in or out, ſtreight or crooked, or turns one way or another: the cloſer the garment ſits to the body, the narrower and ſmaller muſt the folds be.</p>
               <p n="3">III.

               <p n="1">I. LAndskip is that which expreſſeth in lines the perfect viſion of the earth, and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, placed above the horizon, as towns, villages, caſtles, promontaries, mountains, rocks, valleys, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, rivers, woods, foreſts, chaſes, trees, houſes and all other buildings, both beautiful and ruinous.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Firſt, Always expreſs a fair horizon, ſhewing the heavens, cloudy or clear, more or leſs according to the occaſion; and if you expreſs the Sun, let it be either as riſing or ſetting, and as it were behind or over ſome hill or mountain.</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>Or thus,</hi> The picture being drawn as before in the oyled paper, put it upon a ſheet of white paper, and prick over the drawing with a pen: then take ſome ſmall coal, powder it fine, and wrap it in a piece of ſome fine linnen, and bind it up therein looſely, and clap it lightly, all over the pricked line by little and little, and afterwards draw it over again once or twice, with pen or pencil.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Or thus,</hi> Lay a piece of Lanthorn horn upon the picture, then draw the ſtroaks of your picture with a hard nibbed pen upon the horn; and when it is dry, breath upon the horn twice or thrice, and preſs it hard upon white paper a little moiſtned.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ὈΠΤΙΚῊ in Greek, <hi>Perſpectiva</hi> in Latin, the <hi>Art of ſeeing</hi> in Engliſh; is that by which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, contemplate, and draw the likeneſs of all magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, juſt in form and manner as they appear to the Eye.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The matter to be ſeen or ſpeculated is a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: the manner of the ſpeculation is by radiations of Light, either direct, reflected or broken.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A magnitude is that which hath form; and it is either lineal, ſuperficial, or ſolid; that is, either a complication of points, a complication of lines; or a complication of ſuperficies.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. A line is a complication of points; that is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Euclid</hi>) a length only without either breadth or thickneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">V. A ſuperficies is a complication of lines; that is a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100848:37"/>length having breadth without thickneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For as the continuation of points makes a line: ſo the couching of lines makes a ſuperficies: which is only the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of points croſs wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſolid is a complication of ſuperficies; that is, a length and breadth, having depth or thickneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d it is nothing but the continuation of points upon a ſuperficies either perpendicularly or bending.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. The Contemplation of the Object, repreſents the matter to the mind, in the ſame manner as its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance doth to the Eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And from hence comes Judgment whereby the Artiſt is enabled to deſcribe the ſame in lines; and delineate it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its apparent or viſual proportions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. To draw or deſcribe the Appearance in lines is the Active part of this Art, whereby the <hi>Idaea</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the mind (by ſight and contemplation) is brought to light.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. A radiation is a beam of light, conveighing the likeneſs of the thing, to the Eyes, or ſight; and the Knowledge thereof to the mind or underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this radiation is twofold, either external from the external light; or intellectual from its being and power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>Direct radiations,</hi> are thoſe which conſider the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or ſtraight beams, which paſs between the Eye and the object.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this is the firſt kind of Perſpective; and is many times (alone) called the</hi> Opticks.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>Reflected Radiations,</hi> are thoſe which conſider the reflection of beams, and their ſhape upon any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd body, as on a Globe, Cone, Cylinder, Pyramid, or any regular ſolid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this is the ſecond kind of Perſpective, which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Art</hi> Catoptrica.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>Broken Radiations</hi> are thoſe which conſider

               <p>
                  <hi>And this is the third and laſt kind of Perſpective which is called the Art</hi> Dioptrica.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Ichnographia Geometrical,</hi> is that which gives the ſight of the bottom or baſe of any body or building.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So a Circle is the baſe of a Column; and a ſquare is the baſe of a Pedeſtal; and the like; but this</hi> Geometrical Ichnography <hi>is not ſeen in Section, or through a Glaſs, unleſs it lies parallel to the baſe; and ſo it makes no Section with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Ichnographia Scenographical</hi> is the Appearance of the ſame baſe in Section, or through a Glaſs, erected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right on the ſame plain, on which the baſe ſtands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And by this the ſaid baſe is extended in length but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in breadth, for ſo it appears to the Eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Orthographia,</hi> is the Viſion of the foreright ſide of any plain; to wit, of that plain or ſuperficies which lies Equidiſtant to a right line, paſſing through the outward or convex centers of both Eyes, continued to a due length.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore</hi> Perſpective Orthographia, <hi>is the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation of the apparent right plain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scenographia</hi> is the deſcription of a plain or other
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100848:38"/>figure, that declines from the apparent or foreright plain; that is, of that plain which makes Angles with the ſaid foreright plain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Scenographick <hi>viſion of any form, body, or buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is, of that ſide which declines from, or conſtitutes an Angle, with the right line, paſſing from the convex cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of both Eyes aforeſaid: this Artiſts call the</hi> return <hi>of the foreright ſide.

               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Altitude</hi> or <hi>height</hi> is the perpendicular ſpace of place, between the baſe and Eye, or height of the viſual point above the baſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Viſual point,</hi> is a point in the Horizontal line, wherein all the beams of the Eyes unite.</p>
               <p>Exempli gratiâ. <hi>If you look on a long ſtraight river, the ſides of which run parallel, yet by reaſon of the diſtance both ſides of the riven (although it be very broad) will ſeem to incline, touch, and unite with each other in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon point or center: and ſo if you look on a long ſtraight brick-wall, the ſeveral lays of brick, and courſes of mortar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will (at a great diſtance) ſeem to incline
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100848:38"/>each to other in one common point or center; this point re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on a glaſs, raiſed upright on the baſe, is called the Viſual point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Horizontal line</hi> is a line proceeding from the center of the Eye to the viſual point, parallel to the Horizon of the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this is, in men of ordinary height or ſtature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly about five foot from the ground or baſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The <hi>Diſtance</hi> is the ſpace on the baſe, between the Glaſs and point in the baſe which lies directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Eyes.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Section</hi> is a plain of tranſparent or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucid matter (as of Glaſs) raiſed upright on the plain of the baſe ſtanding before you, parallel to a ſtraight line, paſſing through the convex centers of both Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Without the knowledge of this</hi> Section <hi>or</hi> Glaſs, <hi>it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible to underſtand</hi> perſpective, <hi>or know what it means: Or be able to give a reaſon for the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the</hi> Orthographick and Scenographick <hi>figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. If the Glaſs is placed near the viſual point, and far from the object, the figure which is ſeen will be very ſmall: and the reaſon is, becauſe all rays compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Orthographical and Scenographical fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures (though more remote from the object) fall into the viſual point, as their common center.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. If the Viſual point be more elevated (though at the ſame diſtance) the Scenographick figure or form will appear of a much larger magnitude: becauſe the Viſual radiations being higher, the various perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars raiſed on the Section or Glaſs, cut them in wider diſtances, becauſe more remote from the Glaſs.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. If the Glaſs incline to the Viſual point, the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nographick viſion will be long-wiſe between the viſual point and the object.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:100848:39"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the reaſon is, becauſe the plain of the Glaſs heaps in more of the Viſual Radiations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. If the Glaſs recline from the Viſual point, the Scenographick figure will appear rounder, and begin to reſemble the Orthographick.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. But if the Glaſs is fixed Equidiſtant to the bafe, or plain the object ſtands upon; the Scenographick and Orthographick reſemblance will be one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the reaſon is, becauſe the form of the figure is loſt, or not viſible in the Section.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="2">II. Let the lines which in the object return at right Angles from the fore-right-ſide, be drawn Scenogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically from the Viſual point.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100848:39"/>
               <p n="3">III. Let all ſtraight lines, which in the object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the fore-right ſide, run in a Scenographick figure into the Horizontal line.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Let the object you intend to delineate ſtanding on your right hand, be placed alſo on the right hand of the Viſual point: and that on the left hand, on the left hand of the ſame point: and that which is juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the middle of it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Let thoſe lines which are (in the object) E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidiſtant to the returning line, be drawn in the Scenographick figure, from that point found in the Horizon.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. In ſetting off the altitude of Columns, Pedeſtals and the like, meaſure the heighth from the baſe line upwards in the front or fore-right ſide; and a viſual ray drawn, that point in the front ſhall limit the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Column or pillar, all the way behind the fore-right ſide or Orthographick appearance, even to the viſual point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This rule you muſt obſerve in all figures, aſwel where there is a front or fore-right ſide, as where there is none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. In delineating Ovals, Circles, Arches, Croſſes, Spirals and Croſs-arches, or any other figure, in the roof of any room; firſt draw Ichnographically, and ſo with perpendiculars, from the moſt Eminent points thereof, carry it up unto the Ceiling, from which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral points carry on the figure.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The center in any Scenographick regular figure is found by drawing croſs-lines from oppoſite angles: for the point where the Diagonals croſs is the Center.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. A ground plain of ſquares is alike, both above and below the Horizontal line; only the more it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant above or beneath the Horizon, the ſquares
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100848:40"/>will be ſo much the larger or wider.</p>
               <p n="10">X. In drawing a perſpective figure, where many lines come together, you may for the directing of your eye, draw the Diagonals in Red; the Viſual lines in black; the Perpendiculars in Green, or other different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour from that which you intend the figure ſhall be of.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Having conſidered the height, diſtance and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the figure, and drawn it accordingly, with ſide or angle againſt the baſe; raiſe perpendiculars from the ſeveral angles or deſigned points in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, to the baſe, and transfer the length of each perpendicular, from the place where it touches the baſe, to the baſe on the ſide oppoſite to the point of diſtance; ſo will the diametrals drawn to the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars in the baſe, by interſection with the Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals drawn to the ſeveral transferred diſtances, give the Angles of the figure: and ſo lines drawn from point to point will circumſcribe the Scenographick figure.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. If in Landskip there be any ſtanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as rivers, ponds, and the like; place the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal line level with the fartheſt ſight or appearance of it.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. If there be any houſes or the like in the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, conſider their poſition, that you may find from what point in the Horizontal line to draw the fronts and ſides thereof.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. In deſcribing things at a great diſtance, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the proportion (both in magnitude and diſtance) in draught, which appears from the object to the eye.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. In colouring and ſhadowing of every thing; you muſt do the ſame in your picture which you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with your Eye, eſpecially in objects lying near;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100848:40"/>but according as the diſtance grows greater and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo the Colours muſt be fainter and fainter, till at laſt they loſe themſelves in a darkiſh sky colour.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The <hi>Catoptricks</hi> are beſt ſeen in a common looking glaſs or other poliſh'd matter, where if the glaſs be exactly flat, the object is exactly like its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: but if the glaſs be not flat, the reſemblance alters from the original, and that more or leſs, according as the glaſs differs from an exact plain.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. In drawing <hi>Catoptrick</hi> figures, the furface of the Glaſs is to be conſidered, upon which you mean to have the reflection, for which you muſt make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Ichnographical</hi> draught or projection; which on the glaſs muſt appear to be a plain full of ſquares; on which projection transfer what ſhall be drawn, on a plain divided into the ſame number of like ſquares: where though the draught may appear very confuſed, yet the reflection thereof on the Glaſs, will be very regular, proportional and really compoſed.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. The <hi>Dioptrick</hi> or broken beam may be ſeen in a tub; through a Cryſtal, or Glaſs, which hath its ſurface cut into many others, whereby the raies of the object are broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For, to the flat of the Cryſtal or water, the raies run ſtraight; but then they break and make an Angle; the which alſo by the refracted beams is made and continued on the other ſide of the ſame flat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">XIX. When theſe faces on a Cryſtal are turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a plain, placed directly before it, they ſeparate themſelves at a good diſtance on the plain; becauſe they are all directed to various far diſtant places of the ſame.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THe ſoundation of Chiromancie depends upon the true appropriation of the ſeveral mounts, fingers, or places in the hand, to their proper ſtars or Planets.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Ancients have aſſigned the root of the middle finger to <hi>Saturn;</hi> of the forefinger to <hi>Jupiter:</hi> the hollow of the hand to <hi>Mars:</hi> the root of the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger to <hi>Sol:</hi> of the thumb to <hi>Venus:</hi> of the little finger to <hi>Mercury:</hi> and laſtly, the brawn of the hand near the wriſt to <hi>Luna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. That line which comes round the ball of the thumb towards the root or mount of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Linea Jovialis,</hi> or the life-line: that from the wriſt to the root or mount of <hi>Saturn, Linea Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialis:</hi> but if it points to the root or mount of <hi>Sol, Linea Solaris:</hi> if to <hi>Mercury, Linea Mercurealis:</hi> that which goes from <hi>Linea Jovialis</hi> to the mount of <hi>Luna, Linea Lunaris,</hi> or the natural line: the other great line above it is called <hi>Linea Stellata,</hi> or the line of fortune, becauſe it limits the mounts of the planets, and is impreſſed with various vertues in thoſe places according to the nature of the planet whoſe mount it runs under or ſets a boundary unto: Laſtly, the ſpace between the natural line and the line of fortune is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>menſa,</hi> the Table.</p>

               <p n="5">V. Every line great or ſmall, long or ſhort, hath a

               <p n="6">VI. The diſtance between both ends, is the way of its paſſage; in which way, it either croſſes ſome other line, or elſe is croſſed: if it do neither, its ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is continual, and ought ſo much the more to be taken notice of.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>GRaving</hi> is an Art which teachet how to trans fer any deſign upon Copper Braſs, or Wood, by help of ſharp pointed and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Inſtruments.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The chief Inſtruments are four, 1. Gravers, 2. An Oyl ſtone, 3. A Cuſhion, 4. A Burniſher.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Gravers are of three ſorts, round pointed, ſquare pointed, and Lozenge pointed. <hi>The round is beſt to ſcratch withal: the ſquare Graver is to make the largeſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100848:43"/>ſtroaks: the Lozenge is to make ſtroaks more fine and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; but a Graver of a middle ſize betwixt the ſquare and Lozenge pointed, will make the ſtroaks or hatches ſhow with more life and vigour, according as you manage it in working.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Oyl-ſtone is to whet the Gravers upon, which muſt be very ſmooth, not too ſoft, nor too hard, and without pinholes.</p>
               <p>The uſe is thus: <hi>put a few drops of oyl Olive upon the ſtone, and laying that ſide of it, which you intend ſhall cut the Copper, flat upon the ſtone, whet it very flat and eavens and therefore be ſure to carry your hand ſtedfaſt with an equal ſtrength, placing the forefinger firmly, upon the oppoſite ſide of the graver. Then turn the next ſide of your graver, and whet that in like manner, that you may have a very ſharp edge for an Inch or more. Laſtly, turning uppermoſt that edge which you have ſo whetied, and ſetting the end of the graver obliquely upon the ſtone, whet it very flat and ſliping in form of a Lozenge (with an exact and eaven hand) making to the edge thereof a ſharp point. It is impoſſible that the work ſhould be with the neatneſs and curioſity deſired, if the graver be not, not only very good, but alſo exactly and carefully whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The Cuſhion is a leather bag filled with fine ſand, to lay the plate upon, on which you may turn it every way at eaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You muſt turn your plate with your left hand, according as the ſtroaks which you grave do turn, which muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with diligent care and practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. The burniſhing Iron is of uſe to rub out ſcratches and ſpecks or other things which may fault your work in the plate; as alſo if any ſtroaks be graved too deep or groſs to make them appear leſs and fainter by rubbing them therewith.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:100848:44"/>
               <p n="7">VII. To make your Gravers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Provide ſome Croſs-bow ſtell, and cauſe it to be beaten out into ſmall rods, and ſoftned, then with a good file you may ſhape them at pleaſure: when you have done, heat them red-hot, and ſtraight dip it into Soap, and by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it will be very hard:</hi> where note, that in dipping them into the Soap, if you turn your hand never ſo little awry, the graver will be crooked. <hi>If your graver be too hard, take a red-hot Charcoal and lay the end of your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon it till it begins to wax yellowiſh, and then dip it into t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llow (ſome ſay water) and it will be tougher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Have by you a piece of box or hard wood, that after you have ſharpned your graver, by ſtriking the point of it into the ſaid box or hard wood, you may take off all the roughneſs about the points, which was cauſed by whetting it upon the oyl-ſtone.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Laſtly, take a file and touch the edge of the graver therewith; if the file cut it, it is too ſoft, and will do no good: but if it will not touch it, it is fit for your work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it ſhould break on the point, it is a ſign it is tempered too hard; which of tentimes after a little uſe by whetting will come into a good condition.</hi>

Place the knob at the end of the handle of the Graver in the hollow of your hand, and having extended your forefinger towards the point of the Graver, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a top, or oppoſite to the edge which ſhould cut the plate, place your thumb on the one ſide of the Graver, and your other fingers on the other ſide, ſo as that you may guide the graver flat and parallel with the plate.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Be wary that your fingers interpoſe not between
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100848:45"/>the plate and the Graver, for they will hinder you in carrying your graver level with the plate, and cauſe your lines to be more deep, groſs and rugged, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would be.</p>

               <p n="1">I. HAving a Cuſhion filled with ſand about nine inches long and ſix broad, and three or four thick, and a plate well poliſhed; lay the plate upon the Cuſhion, which place upon a firm Table.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Holding the Graver (as aforeſaid) according to art, in making ſtraight ſtroaks be ſure to hold your plate firm upon the Cuſhion, moving your hand, leaning lightly where the ſtroak ſhould be fine; and harder where you would have the ſtroak broader.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But in making circular or crooked ſtroaks, hold your hand and Graver ſtedfaſt, your arm and elbow reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the table, and move the plate againſt the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for otherwiſe it is impoſſible to make thoſe crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or winding ſtroaks with that neatneſs and command that you ought to do.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Learn to carry your hand with ſuch a ſlight, that you may end your ſtroak as finely as you began it; and if you have occaſion to make one part deeper or blacker than another, do it by degrees; and that you may do it the more exactly, obſerve that your ſtroaks be not too cloſe, nor too wide.</p>
               <p>For your more exact obſervation, practiſe by ſuch prints which are more looſly ſhadowed, leſt by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the more dark, you ſhould not know where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin or end.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:100848:45"/>
               <p n="5">V. After you have graved part of your work, it will be needful to ſcrape it with the ſharp edge of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher or other graver, carrying it along eaven with the plate, to take off the roughneſs of the ſtroaks; but in doing it beware of making ſcratches.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And that you may the better ſee that which is engraven, with the piece of Felt or Caſtor (at the fourth Section of the ſecond Chapter) dipt in oyl rub the places graven.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, whatſoever appears to be amiſs, you may rub out with the burniſher, and very exactly poliſh it with your piece of Felt or Caſtor and oyl; which done, to cleanſe the plate you may boil it a little in wine vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and rub it gently with a bruſh of ſmall braſs wire or hogs briſtles.</p>

               <p n="1">I. HAving a piece of Bees wax tyed up in a fine hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land rag, heat the plate over the fire, till it may be hot enough to melt the wax; then rub the plate with the wax tied up in the rag, till you ſee it covered all over with wax, (which let be very thin:) if it be not eaven, heat it again by the fire, and wipe it over gently with a feather.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If you would coppy a printed picture, to have it print off the ſame way; then clap the print which you would imitate with the printed ſide next to the plate; and having placed it very exactly, rub the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the print with a burniſher, or any thing that is hard, ſmooth and round, which will cauſe it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100848:46"/>to ſtick to the wax upon the plate: then take off the print (beginning at one corner) gently and with care, leſt you tear it (which may be cauſed alſo by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too much wax upon the plate) and it will leave upon the wax the perfect proportion in every part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where note, if it be an old picture, before you place it upon the wax, it will be good to track it over in every limb with a black-lead penſil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. But if you would have it print the contrary way; take the duſt of black-lead, and rub the backſide of the print all over therewith, which black ſide put upon the waxed plate; and with your needle or drawing point, draw all the out-lines of the deſign or print, all which you will find upon the wax. This done,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Take a long graver either Lozenge or round (which is better) very ſharp, and with the point there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſcratch over every particular limb in the outſtroke; which done, it will not be difficult to mark out all the ſhadows as you engrave, having the proportion before you.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Laſtly, for Coppies or Letters, go over every letter with black-lead, or write them with ungumm'd Ink, and clap the paper over the waxed plate as before.</p>

               <p>THe figures that are to be carved or geaven in wood muſt firſt be drawn, traced, or paſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wood; and afterwards all the other ſtanding of the wood (except the figure) muſt be cut away
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100848:46"/>with little narrow pointed knives made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This graving in wood is far more tedious and difficult than that in Braſs or Copper; becauſe you muſt cut twice or thrice to take out one ſtroak; and having cut it, to be careful in picking it out, leſt you ſhould break any part of the work, which would deface it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. For the kind of the wood let it be hard and tough: the beſt for this purpoſe is Beech and Box: let it be plained inch thick, which you may have cut into pieces according to the bigneſs of the figure you grave.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To draw the figures upon the wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grinde white Lead very fine, and temper it with fair water; dip a cloth therein, and rub over one ſide of the wood, and let it dry throughly: This keepeth the Ink (if you draw therewith) that it run not about, nor ſink: and if you draw with Paſtils, it makes the ſtroaks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more plain and bright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Having whited the wood as before (if it is a figure you would copy) black or red the blankſide of the print or copy, and with a little ſtick or ſwallows quill, trace or draw over the ſtroaks of the figure.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But if you paſte the figure upon the wood, you muſt not then white it over (for then the figure will pill off) but only ſee the wood be well plained: then wipe over the printed ſide of the figure with Gum Tragacanth diſſolved in fair water, and clap it ſmooth upon the wood, which let dry throughly: then wet it a little all over, and fret off the paper gently, till you can ſee perfectly every ſtrock of the figure: dry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and fall to cutting or carving it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Although in chap. 2. of this Book, we have ſufficiently taught how to poliſh the Plate, yet nevertheleſs we think it convenient to ſubjoyn theſe following words. Firſt, the Plate being well planiſhed or forged, choſe the ſmootheſt ſide to poliſh; then fix it upon a board a little declining, and rub it firmly and eavenly all over with a piece of Grindſtone, throwing water often on it, ſo long till there be no dints, flaws or marks of the hammer: waſh it clean, and with a piece of good Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice ſtone, rub it ſo long till there be no rough ſtroaks or marks of the Grindſtone: waſh it clean again, and rub it with a fine Hoan and water, till the marks of the pumice ſtone are rubbed out: waſh it again, and with a piece of Charcoal without knots (being heat red hot and quenched in water, the outſide being pared off) rub the plate with water till all the ſmall ſtroaks of the Hoan be vaniſhed; laſtly, if yet there remain any ſmall ſtroaks or ſcratches, rub them out with the end of the burniſhing Iron, ſo ſhall the Plate be fitted for work.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>To make the hard Varniſh for Etching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Greek or Burgundy Pitch, Colophonium or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100848:47"/>Rozin, of each five ounces, Nut-oyl four ounces; melt the Pitch and Rozin in an earthen pot upon a gentle fire; then put in the Oyl, and let them boil for the ſpace of half an hour: Cool it a little upon a ſofter fire till it appear like a Glewy ſyrrup: cool it a little more, ſtrain it, and being almoſt cold, put it into a Glaſs bottle for uſe. Being thus made it will keep at leaſt twenty years.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>To make the ſoft Varniſh for Etching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Virgin-wax three ounces, Maſtich in drops two ounces, Aſphaltum one ounce: grind the Maſtich and Aſphaltum ſeverally very fine; then in an Earthen pot melt the Wax, and ſtrew in the Maſtich and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaltum, ſtirring all upon the fire till they be well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and mixed, which will be in about half a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour; then cooling it a little, pouring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a baſin of fair water (all except the dregs) and with your hands wet (before it is cold) form it into rouls.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>To make the prepared Oyl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Oyl Olive, make it hot in an Earthen pot, and put into it a ſufficient quantity of tried ſheeps ſuet (ſo much as being dropped upon a cold thing, the oyl may be a little hardened and firm) boil them together for an hour, till they be of a reddiſh colour, leſt they ſhould ſeparate when you uſe them. This mixture is to make the fat more liquid, and not cool ſo faſt, for the fat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone would be no ſooner on the pencil, but it would grow cold; and be ſure to put in more oyl in Winter than in Summer.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>To make the Aqua fortis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take diſtilled White-wine Vinegar three pints; Sal Armoniack, Bay-falt, of each ſix ounces; Vertegrieſe four ounces. Put all together into a large well glazed earthen pot (that they may not bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100848:48"/>pot cloſe, and put it on a quick fire, and let it ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boil two or three great walms and no more; when it is ready to boil, uncover the pot, and ſtir it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a ſtick, taking heed that it boil not over: having boiled, take it from the fire, and let it cool be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe covered, and when it is cold, put it into a glaſs bottle with a glaſs ſtopple: If it be too ſtrong in Etching, weaken it with a glaſs or two of the ſame Vinegar you made it of. There is another ſort of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua fortis, which is called Common, which is exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Synopſis Medicinae, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 656. But becauſe that Book may not be in every mans hand, we will here inſert it; it is thus: Take dried Vitriol two pound, Salt-peter one pound; mix them and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil by a Retort, in open fire by degrees.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>To make the Etching Needles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Choſe Needles of ſeveral ſizes, ſuch as will break without bending, and of a fine grain; then take good round ſticks of firm wood (not apt to ſplit) about ſix inches long, and as thick as a large Gooſe quill, at the ends of which fix your Needles, ſo that they may ſtand out of the ſticks about a quarter of an inch or ſomething more.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>To whet the points of the Needles with the Oylſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you would have them whetted round, you muſt whet their points ſhort upon the oyl ſtone, (not as ſowing Needls are) turning them round whilſt you whet them, as Turners do. If you whet them ſloping, firſt make them blunt upon the oyl ſtone, then holding them firm and ſteady, whet them ſloping upon one ſide only, till they come to a ſhort and roundiſh oval.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The Bruſh pencil is to cleanſe the work, wipe off duſt, and to ſtrike the Colours eaven over the ground or varniſh, when laid upon the Plate.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The burniſher is a well hardened piece of ſteel
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100848:48"/>ſomewhat roundiſh at the end. Its uſes are what we have ſpoken at the ſixth Section of the firſt Chapter, and the third Section of the ſecond Chapter.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>To make the Frame and Trough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Frame is an entire board, about whoſe top and ſides is faſtned a ledge two Inches broad, to keep the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> from running off from the ſides when you pour it on: the lower end of this board muſt be placed in the Trough, leaning ſloping againſt a wall or ſome other thing, wherein you muſt fix ſeveral pegs of wood to reſt the plate upon. The Trough is made of a firm piece of Elm or Oak ſet upon four legs, whoſe hollow is four Inches wide; and ſo long as may beſt fit your uſe: the hollow muſt be ſomething deeper in the middle, that the water running thither may fall through a hole (there made for that purpoſe) into an earthen pan well leaded. <hi>The inſide of this board and trough muſt be covered over with a thick oyl colour, to hinder the</hi> Aqua fortis <hi>from eating or rotting the board.</hi>

HAving well heat the poliſhed Plate over a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing-diſh of coals, take ſome of the firſt var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with a little ſtick, and put a drop of it on the top of your finger, with which lightly touch the Plate at equal diſtances, laying on the varniſh equally, and heating the plate again as it grows cold, keeping it carefully from duſt or filth; then with the ball of your thumb tap it upon the plate; ſtill wiping your hand over all, to make it more ſmooth and equal.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And here beware that neither the varniſh be too thick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the plate, nor your hand ſweaty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Then take a great lighted candle burning clear, with a ſhort ſnuff, (placing the corner of the plate againſt a wall) hold the varniſhed ſide downward o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the candle, as cloſe as you can, ſo it touch not the Varniſh, guiding the flame all over, till it is all perfectly black; which you muſt keep from duſt or filth till it is dry.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Over a fire of Charcoals hang the varniſhed plate to dry with the varniſh upwards, which will ſmoak; when the ſmoak abates, take away the plate, and with a pointed ſtick ſcratch near the ſide thereof, and if the varniſh eaſily comes off, hang it over the fire again a little, ſo long till the Varniſh will not too eaſily come off; then take it from the fire and let it cool.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the varniſh ſhould be too hard, caſt cold water on the back-ſide of the plate to cool it, that the heat may not make it too hard and brittle.</hi> This done,</p>

               <p n="1">I. IN making lines or hatches, ſome bigger, ſome leſſer, ſtraight or crooked, you muſt uſe ſeveral ſorts of needles, bigger or leſſer as the work requires.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The great lines are made by leaning hard on the needle; its point being ſhort and thick, (but a round point will not cut the varniſh clear:) or, by making divers lines or hatches, one very cloſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and then by paſſing over them again with a thicker needle; or, by making them with an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent large needle, and letting the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> lie the longer thereon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The beſt needles for this work are ſuch as are whet ſloping with an oval, becauſe their ſides will cut that which the round ones will not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. If your lines or hatches ought to be of an equal thickneſs from end to end, lean on the needle with an equal force; leaning lightly where you would have the lines or ſtroaks fine or ſmall; and more heavy where you would have the line appear deep or large; thereby the needle may have ſome Impreſſion in the Copper.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If your lines or hatches be too ſmall, paſs over them again with a ſhort round point, of ſuch a bigneſs as you would have the line of, leaning ſtrongly where you would have the line deep.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The manner of holding the needle with Oval points (which are moſt proper to make large and deep ſtroaks) is much like that of a pen, only the flat ſide whetted is uſually held towards the thumb: but they may be uſed with the face of the Oval turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the middle finger.</p>

               <p n="6">VI. If you would end with a fine ſtroak, you ought to do that with a very fine needle.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. In uſing the Oval points, hold them as upright and ſtraight in your hand as you can, ſtriking your ſtroaks firmly and freely, for that will add much to their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and clearneſs.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. In Landskips, in places fartheſt from the ſight, as alſo neareſt the light, uſe a very ſtender point, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo lightly with your hand as to make a ſmall faint ſtroak.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Then take a bruſh, pencil, or rag, and dip it in the prepared oyl, and rub the back ſide of the plate all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> may not hurt it, if by chance any ſhould fall thereon.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Before you put the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> to the plate, gently warm or dry the plate by a fire to dry up the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, which it might contract by reaſon of the Air; and to prevent the breaking up the Varniſh upon the firſt pouring the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> thereon.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Place the plate by the 12th. Section of the 7th. Chapter of this book, and with the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> in an Earthen pot pour upon the plate, begiming at the top,

               </p>
               <p n="5">V. But you muſt have ſpecial regard to caſt on the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> as occaſion ſhall require, and work is; caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on at ſeveral times, and on ſeveral places; where you would have it very deep, often; where leſs deep fewer times: where light, leſs yet; where lighter, leſſer yet: and where ſo light as it can ſcarcely be ſeen, once or twice: waſh it with water, and cover it where you would have it lighter.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Having thus covered your plates as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; for the ſecond time, place the plate on the frame as aforeſaid, and pour on it your <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> for a full half hour.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Then waſh it with water and dry it, covering the places which require lightneſs or faintneſs (that they may be proportionable to the deſign) then pour on the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> for the laſt time more or leſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of your work, and the deepnſes that it requires.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. You may rub off the varniſh or ground, as occaſion in your work requires with a Charcoal, to ſee whether the water hath eaten deep enough; by which you may judge of the ſpace of time, that you are after to employ in pouring on the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> in the works you will have to do, which if the ſhadows
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100848:51"/>require much depth, or ought to be very black, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ought to be poured on (at the leaſt time) for an hour or better; yet know <hi>no certain rule of time can be limited for this.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. ALL the former operations being done, waſh the Plate with fair water; and put it wet upon the fire, till the mixture be well melted, and then wipe it very clean on both ſides with a linnen cloth, till you have cleanſed it of all the mixture.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Take Charcoal of Willow, take off the rind of it, and putting fair water on the plate, rub it with the Charcoal, as if you were to poliſh it, and it will take off the varniſh.</p>
               <p>Where note, that the Coal muſt be free from all knots and roughneſs, and that no ſand or filth fall upon the plate.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Take ordinary <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> to which add two third parts of water, and with ſome linnen rags dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped therein, rub the Plate all over, ſo will you take away its diſcolouring, and recover its former beauty.</p>

               <p>THE Plate being prepared by cleanſing it with a Charcoal and clean water, waſh it well and dry it, then with fine white Chalk ſcraped and a fine rag, rub it well over, not touching it with your fingers.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Lay down your plate over a Chafing-diſh of ſmall coal, yet ſo as the fire may have air; then take the Ground or ſoft Varniſh (it being tyed up in a fine rag) and rub it up and down the Copper, ſo as it may ſufficiently cover it, (not too thin nor too thick:) then take a feather and ſmooth it as well as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you can all one way, and then croſs it, till it lie very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you muſt take heed that the Plate be not too hot, for if it lie till the Ground ſmoak, the moiſture will be dried up, and that will ſpoil the work, and make the Ground break or fly up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Then grind ſome white Lead with Gum wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo that it may be of a convenient thickneſs to ſpread on the Copper; and with a large pencil, or ſmall bruſh, ſtrike the Plate croſs over, twice or thrice till it is ſmooth; and then with a larger bruſh (made of Squirrels tails) gently ſmooth the white, and then let it lie till it is drie.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>The way of Etching upon the ſoft Varniſh.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THE way of Etching is the ſame with that in the hard Varniſh; only you muſt be careful not to hurt your varniſh, which you may do by placing on the ſides of your plate two little boards, and laying croſs over them another thin one, ſo as that it may not touch the plate, on which you muſt reſt your hand whilſt you work.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Then place the plate on a Desk (if you ſo pleaſe) for by that means the ſuperfluous matter will fall away of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But if you have any deſign to transfer upon the plate from any Copy or Print, ſcrape on the backſide thereof ſome red Chalk all over; then go over that, by ſcraping ſome ſoft Charcoal, till it mingle with the Chalk; and with a large ſtiff pencil rub it all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till it be fine and eaven, and ſo lay down the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon the plate: with a blunt Needle draw over the out ſtroaks: <hi>and as you work, you need not ſcratch hard into the Copper, only ſo as you may ſee the Needle go through the Varniſh to the Copper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Always be ſure when you leave the work, to wrap the Plate up in Paper, to keep it from hurt, and corrupting in the air, which may drie the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh: and in Winter time wrap the Plate up in a piece of wollen, as well as paper; for if the froſt get to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100848:52"/>it, it will cauſe the Varniſh to riſe from the Copper in the eating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An inconveniency alſo will accrew, by letting the Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh lie too long upon the Plate before the work is finiſhed; for three or four months will conſume the moiſture and ſo ſpoil all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The marking of the deſign upon the ſoft var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, is beſt done with black Lead or Chalk, if the ground is white; but with red Chalk, if the ground is black.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Having graved what you intend upon the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, take ſome fair water, a little warm, and caſt it upon the plate; and then with a ſoft clean Sponge, rub upon the white Lead to moiſten it all over; and then waſh the plate to take away the whiting, and drie it.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Or laſtly, with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> mixed with fair water, waſh it all over, and by this means you may take away the whiting, which then waſh with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water and drie it; and thus have you the plate prepared for the <hi>Aquafortis.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. PUt ſoft Wax (red or green) round the brims of the Plate, and let it be raiſed above the varniſh about half a Barley corns length; ſo that placing the plate level, the water being poured upon the Plate may by this means be retained. This done,</p>
               <p n="2">II. Take common <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> ſix ounces, Common water two ounces; mix them, and pour it gently
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100848:53"/>upon the plate, ſo that it may cover it fully all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; ſo will the ſtronger hatchings be full of bubbles, while the fainter will appear clear for a while, not making any ſudden operations to the view.</p>
               <p n="3">III. When you perceive the water to operate a ſmall time, pour it off into a glazed carthen diſh, and throw fair water upon the Plate, to waſh away the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> then drie the plate: and where you would have the Cut to be faint, tender or ſweet, cover it with the prepared Oil, and then cover the Plate again with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> as before, leaving it on for eight or ten minutes, or longer: then put off the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua fortis</hi> as before, waſhing and drying the Plate, and covering with the prepared Oyl other places which you would not have ſo deep as the reſt: Laſtly, put on the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> again, for the ſpace of half an hour (more or leſs) and then pour it off, waſhing the plate with fair water as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As you would have your lines or ſtrokes to be deeper and deeper, ſo cover the ſweeter or fainter parts by degrees with the prepared oyl, that the Aqua fortis may lie the longer on the deep ſtroaks.</hi> Then</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Take off the border of Wax, and heat the plate, ſo that the oyl and varniſh may throughly melt; which wipe away well with a linnen cloth: then rub the plate over with oyl Olive and a piece of an old beaver roll'd up, which done, touch it with the Graver where need is.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But if any thing be (at laſt) forgotten; then rub the plate aforeſaid with crums of bread, ſo well that no filth or oyl remain upon the Plate.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Then heat the plate upon a Charcoal fire, and ſpread the ſoft varniſh with a feather upon it (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſo that the hatchings may be filled with varniſh; black it, and then touch it over again, or add what you intend.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THe chief of all is <hi>Gum-Arabick,</hi> that which is white, clear and brittle; the Gum-water of it is made thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take Gum-Arabick, bruiſe it and tie it up in a fine clean linnen cloath, and put it into a convenient quantity of pure ſpring-water, in a glaſs or earthen veſſel; letting the Gum remain there till it is diſſolved; which done, if the water is not ſtiff enough, put more Gum into the cloath; but if too ſtiff, add more water:</hi> of which Gum-water have two ſorts by you, the one ſtrong, the other weak, of which you may make a third at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But if you be where Gum-Arabick is not to be got, you may inſtead of that uſe the preparation of ſheeps leather or parchment following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of the ſhreds of white ſheep-skins (which are to be bad plentifully at Glovers) or elſe of parchments, one pound; Conduit or running-water two quarts, boyl it to a thin gelly, then ſtrain it whilſt bot through a fine ſtrainen, and ſo uſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Gum-lake;</hi> it is made of whites of Eggs beaten and ſtrained, a pint, Honey, Gum-hedera of each two Drachms, ſtrong wort four ſpoonfuls, mix them, and ſtrain them with a piece of ſpunge till they run like a clear oyl, which keep in a clean veſſel till it grows hard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Gum will diſſolve in water like Gum-Arabick, of which Gum-water is made in like manner; it is a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Varniſh for Pictures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Gum-Hedera,</hi> or Gum of Ivy; it is gotten out of Ivy, by cutting with an Axe a great branch thereof,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100848:54"/>climbing upon an Oak-tree, and bruiſing the ends of it with the head of the Axe; at a Months end, or thereabouts, you may take from it a very clear, and pure fine Gum, like oyl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is good to put into gold ſize and other colours, for theſe three reaſons:</hi> 1. <hi>It abates the ill ſcent of the ſize:</hi> 2. <hi>It will prevent bubbles in gold ſize and other colours:</hi> 3. <hi>Laſtly, it takes the fat and clammineſs off colours: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which it is of uſe in making Pomanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Gum Armoniacum,</hi> It is a Forrein Gum, and ought to be brought ſtrained. <hi>Grind it very fine with juyce of Garlick and a little Gum-Arabick water, ſo that it may not be too thick, but that you may write with it what you will:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When you uſe it, draw what you will with it, and let it dry; and when you gild upon it, cut your Gold or Silver, to the faſhion which you drew with the ſize or gum; then breath upon the ſize, and lay the Gold upon it gently taken up, which preſs down hard with a piece of wool; and then let it well dry; being dryed, with a fine linnen cloath ſtrike off the looſe gold; ſo will what was drawn be fairly gilded if it was as fine as a hair: it is called Gold Armoniack.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. <hi>CEruſe,</hi> Grind it with glair of Eggs, and it will make a moſt perfect white.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>White-lead,</hi> Grind it with a weak water of Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake, and let it ſtand three or four days, after which if you mix with it Roſet and Vermilion, it makes a fair Carnation.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Spaniſh-white,</hi> It is the beſt white of all, to garniſh with, ground with weak Gum-water.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Lamp black,</hi> ground with Gum-water, it makes a good black.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Vermilion,</hi> Grind it with the glair of an Egg, and in the grinding put a little clarified honey, to make its colour bright and perfect.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Sinaper-lake,</hi> it makes a deep and beautiful red, or rather purple, almoſt like unto a Red-roſe. Grind it with Gum-lake and Turnſole water: if you will have it light, add a little Ceruſe, and it will make it a bright Crimſon; if to Diaper, add only Turnſole water.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Red-lead,</hi> Grind it with ſome Saffron, and ſtiff Gum-lake; for the Saffron makes it orient, and of a Marigold colour.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Turnſole,</hi> Lay it in a Sawcer of Vinegar, and ſet it over a chafing-diſh of coals; let it boil, then take it off, and wring it into a Shell, adding a little Gum-Arabick, let it ſtand till it is diſſolved: It is good to ſhadow Carnation, and all Yellows.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Roſet,</hi> Grind it with Brazil-water, and it will make a deep purple: put Ceruſe to it, and it will be lighter; grind it with Litmoſe, and it will make a fair Violet.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:100848:56"/>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>Spaniſh brown,</hi> Grind it with Brazil-water: min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it with Ceruſe and it makes a horſe-fleſh Colour.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>Bole Armoniack,</hi> It is a faint Colour; its chief uſe is, in making ſize for burniſh'd gold.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>Greenbice,</hi> Order it as you do blew bice; when it is moyſt, and not through dry, you may diaper upon it with the water of deep green.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Verdegrieſe,</hi> Grind it with juyce of Rue, and a little weak gum-water, and you will have a moſt pure green: if you will diaper with it, grind it with Lye of Rue (or elſe the decoction thereof) and there will be a hoary green: Diaper upon Verdegrieſe green with ſap-green: alſo Verdegrieſe ground with white Tartar, and then tempered with gum-water, gives a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect green.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Verditure,</hi> grind it with a weak Gum-Arabick water: it is the fainteſt green that is, but is good to lay upon black, in any kind of drapery.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. <hi>Sap-green,</hi> lay it in ſharp vinegar all night; put it into a little Alom to raiſe its colour, and you will have a good green to diaper upon other greens.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Orpiment, Arſenicum</hi> or <hi>Auripigmentum,</hi> grind it with a ſtiff water of Gum-lake, becauſe it is the beſt colour of it ſelf; it will lie upon no green, for all greens, white and red lead, and Ceruſe ſtain it: wherefore you muſt deepen your colours ſo that the Orpiment may be higheſt, and ſo it may agree with all Colours.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. <hi>Maſticot,</hi> Grind it with a ſmall quantity of Saffron in gum-water, and never make it lighter than it is: it will endure to lie upon all colours and metals.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>Saffron,</hi> Steep it in Glair: it may be ground with Vermilion.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. <hi>Pink-yellow,</hi> If you would have it ſad coloured, grind it with Saffron; if light, with Ceruſe: mix it with weak gum-water, and ſo uſe it.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramarine,</hi> If you would have it deep, grind it with Litmoſe-water; but if light, with fine Ceruſe, and a weak Gum-Arabick water.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. <hi>Indico,</hi> Grind it with water of Gum-Arabick, as Ultramarine.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. <hi>Blew bice,</hi> Grind it with clean water, as ſmall as you can, then put it into a ſhell, and waſh it thus: put as much water to it as will fill up the veſſel or ſhell, and ſtir it well, let it ſtand an hour, and the filth and dirty water caſt away; then put in more clean water, do thus four or five times; and at laſt put in Gum-Arabick water ſomewhat weak, that the Bice may fall to the bottom; pour off the gum-water, and put more to it, waſh it again, drie it, and mix it with weak gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water (if you would have it riſe of the ſame colour) but with a ſtiff water of Gum-lake, if you would have a moſt perfect blew; if a light blew, grind it with a little Ceruſe; but if a moſt deep blew, add water of Litmoſe.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. <hi>Smalt,</hi> Grind it with a little fine Roſet, and it will make a deep Violet: and by putting in a quantity of Ceruſe, it will make a light Violet.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. <hi>Litmoſe blew,</hi> Grind it with Ceruſe: with too much Litmoſe it makes a deep blew; with too much Ceruſe, a light blew: grind it with the weak water of Gum-Arabick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take fine Litmoſe, cut it in pieces, lay it in weak water of Gum-lake for twenty four hours, and you ſhall have a water of a moſt perfect Azure; with which water you may

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. COlours, according to their natures, have each a particular way of preparation: to wit, by grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waſhing or ſteeping.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The chief <hi>Colours to be ground</hi> are theſe; White Lead, Ceruſe, Sinaper Lake, Oker, Pink, Indico, Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Colens Earth, Spaniſh Brown, Ivory Black, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſtone Black.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The chief <hi>Colours to be waſh'd</hi> are Red Lead, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticot, green Bice, Cedar green, Ultramarine, blew Bice, Smalt, Verditure.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The chief <hi>Colours to be ſteep'd,</hi> are Sap-green, Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, Turnſole, Stone blew, Venice berries.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>To Grind Colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take the colour you would grind, and ſcrape off from it all the filth, then lay it upon the ſtone, and with the muller bruiſe it a little; then put thereto a little ſpring water, and grind all together very well, till the colour is very fine; which done, pour it out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain hollows or furrows cut in chalk-ſtone, and there let it lie till it is dry, which reſerve in papers or glaſſes.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>To Waſh colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put the colour into a glazed veſſel, and put thereto fair water plentifully, waſh it well, and decant (after a while) the water; do this ſix or ſeven times; at laſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100848:61"/>put the water (being juſt troubled) into another glazed veſſel, leaving the dregs at bottom: then into this ſecond veſſel put more fair water, waſhing it as before, till the water (being ſettled) be clear, and the colour remain fine at bottom: we have taught another way at the twenty fourth Section of the eighteenth Chapter of this Book.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>To ſteep Colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take a quantity thereof, and put it into a ſhell, and fill the ſhell with fair water, to which add ſome fine powder of Alom, to raiſe the Colour; let it thus ſteep a day and night, and you will have a good colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where note; Saffron ſteeped in vinegar gives a good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and the Venice berries in fair water and a little Alom, or a drop or two of oyl of Vitriol makes a fair yellow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>To temper the colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take a little of any colour, and put it into a clean ſhell, and add thereto a few drops of gum water, and with your fingers work it about the ſhell, then let it dry; when dry, touch it with your fingers, if any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour comes off, you muſt add ſtronger gum water: but being dry, if the colour gliſter or ſhine, it is a ſign there is too much gum in it, which you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy by putting in fair water.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>To help the defects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some colours as Lake, Umber, and others which are hard, will crack when they are dry; in this caſe, in tempering them add a little white Sugar candy in very fine powder, which mix with the colour and fair water in the ſhell, till the Sugar candy is diſſolved.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Theſe colours, Umber, Spaniſh brown, Colen earth, Cherryſtone, and Ivory black, are to be burnt before they be ground or waſh'd.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>To burn or calcine Colours.</hi>

               <p>This is done in a crucible, covering the mouth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with clay, and ſetting it in a hot fire, till you are ſure it is red hot through: which done, being cold, waſh or grind it as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Grinding ſtone</hi> may be of Porphury, Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine or Marble, but rather a Pebble, for that is the beſt of all others: the Muller only of pebble, which keep very clean.</p>

               <p>After uſing them, rub the ends of them well with ſoap, then lay them a while in warm water to ſteep, then take them out and waſh them well in other fair water.</p>

               <p>It muſt be made of pure fine paſte-board, ſuch as Cards are made of (of what thickneſs you pleaſe) very finely ſlick'd and glazed. Take a piece of this paſte-board of the bigneſs you intend the picture, and a piece of the fineſt and whiteſt parchment you can get (virgin parchment) which cut of equal bigneſs with the paſte board; with thin, white, new made ſtarch, paſte the parchment to the paſte-board, with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the skin outwardmoſt: lay on the ſtarch very thin and eaven; then the grinding ſtone being clean, lay the card thereon with the parchment ſide down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and as hard as you can, rub the other ſide of the paſte-board with a Boars tooth ſet in a ſtick; then let it be thorow drie, and it will be fit to work or limn any curious thing upon.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The ſhells holding or containing your colours, ought to be Horſe-muſcle ſhells, which may be got in July about Rivers ſides; but the next to theſe are ſmall muſcle ſhells, or in ſtead thereof little China or glaſs veſſels.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. A Paper with a hole cut therein, to lay over the Card, to keep it from duſt and filth, to reſt your hand upon, and to keep the ſoil and ſweat of your hand from ſullying the parchment, as alſo to try your pencils on before you uſe them.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100848:64"/>graces or deformities, ſweetly couching the colours, which will take up about five hours time: at the third ſitting finiſh the face, in which you muſt perfect all that is imperfect and rough, putting the deep ſhadows in the face, as in the eyes, eye-brows, and ears, which are the laſt of the work, and not to be done till the hair curtain, or backſide of the picture, and the drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be wholly finiſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>The operation or work at firſt ſitting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground for the complexion being laid, draw the out-lines of the face, which do with Lake and white mingled; draw faintly, that if you miſs in proportion or colour you may alter it: this done, add to the former colour red Lead, for the cheeks and lips; let it be but faint (for you cannot lighten a deep co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour) and make the ſhadows in their due places, as in the checks, lips, tip of the chin and ears, the eyes and roots of the hair: ſhadow not with a flat pencil, but by ſmall touches (as in hatching) and ſo go over the face. In this dead covering rather than to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſtrive as near as may be to imitate nature. The red ſhadows being put in their due places; ſhadow with a faint blew, about the corners and balls of the eyes; and with a grayiſh blew under the eyes and about the temples, heightning the ſhadows as the light falls, as alſo the harder ſhadows in the dark ſide of the face, under the eye-brows, chin and neck. Bring all the work to an equality, but add perfection to no particular part at this time; but imitate the life in likeneſs, round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, boldneſs, poſture, colour, and the like. Laſtly, touch at the hair with a ſutable colour in ſuch curls, folds and form, as may either agree with the life, or grace the picture; fill the empty places with colour, and deepen it more ſtrongly, than in the deepeſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed before.</p>

               <p n="3">III. <hi>The operation or work at ſecond ſitting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As before rudely, ſo now you muſt ſweeten thoſe varieties which Nature affords, with the ſame colours and in the ſame places, driving them one into another, yet ſo as that no lump or ſpot of colour, or rough edge may appear in the whole work; and this muſt be done with a pencil ſharper than that which was uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This done, go to the backſide of the picture, which may be Landskip, or a curtain of blew or red Sattin: if of blew, temper as much Bice as will cover a Card, and let it be well mixed with gum; with a pencil draw the out-line of the Curtain; as alſo of the whole picture; then with a large pencil lay thinly or airily over the whole ground, on which you mean to lay the blew; and then with a large pencil, lay over the ſame a ſubſtantial body of colour; in doing of which, be nimble, keeping the colour moiſt, letting no part thereof be drie till the whole be covered. If the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be crimſon, trace it out with lake; lay the ground with a thin colour; and lay the light with a thin and wateriſh colour, where they fall; and while the ground is yet wet, with a ſtrong dark colour tempered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thick, lay the ſtrong and hard ſhadows cloſe by the other lights. Then lay the linnen with faint white, and the drapery flat, of the colour you intend it. In the face, ſee what ſhadows are too light or too deep, for the Curtain behind, and drapery, and reduce each to their due perfection; draw the lines of the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, and ſhadow the entrance into the ear, deepneſs of the eye-brows, and eminent marks in the face, with a very ſharp pencil: laſtly, go over the hair, colouring it as it appears in the life, caſting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ground ſome looſe hairs, which will make the picture ſtand as it were at a diſtance from the curtain: <hi>Shadow the linnen with white, black,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100848:65"/>and a little yellow and blew; and deepen your black with Ivory black, mixed with a little Lake and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieo.</hi>

               <p n="4">IV. <hi>The operation or work at third ſitting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This third work is wholly ſpent in giving ſtrong touches where you ſee cauſe; in rounding, ſmoothing and colouring the face, which you may better ſee to do, now the curtain and drapery is limned than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

                  <hi>ALL the variable expreſſions of Landskip are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they being as many as there are men and fancies; the general rules follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Always begin with the Sky, Sunbeams, or lighteſt parts firſt; next the yellowiſh beams (which make of Maſticot and white) next the blewneſs of the Skie, (which make of Smalt only.)</p>
               <p n="2">II. At firſt colouring, leave no part of the ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but lay the colours ſmooth all over.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Work the Sky downwards: towards the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon fainter and fainter, as it draws nearer and nearer
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100848:66"/>the earth: the tops of mountains far remote, work ſo faint that they may appear as loſt in the air.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Let places low, and near the ground be of the colour of the earth, of a dark yellowiſh, or brown green; the next lighter green; and ſo ſucceſſively as they loſe in diſtance, let them abate in colour.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Make nothing which you ſee at a diſtance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by expreſſing any particular ſign which it hath, but expreſs it in colours, as weakly and faintly as the eye judgeth of it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Always place light againſt darkneſs and darkneſs againſt light, by which means you may extend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as a very far off.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Let all ſhadows loſe their force as they remove from the eye; always letting the ſtrongeſt ſhadow be neareſt hand.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Laſtly, Take Iſinglaſs in ſmall pieces half an ounce, fair Conduit water two quarts, boil it till the glaſs is diſſolved, which ſave for uſe: with which mix ſpirit or oyl of Cloves, Roſes, Cinnamon or Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieſe, and lay it on and about the Picture where it is not coloured (leſt it ſhould change the Colours: but upon the Colours uſe it without the perfumes) ſo it will varniſh your Pictures, and give them a gloſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the glory of their colours, and take from them any ill ſcent which they might otherwiſe retain.</p>

               <p n="1">I. PAinting in Oyl is nothing but the work or Art of Limning performed with colours made up or mixed with oyl.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Materials of Painting are chiefly ſeven, 1. <hi>The Eaſel,</hi> 2. <hi>The Pallet,</hi> 3. <hi>The Straining frame,</hi> 4. <hi>The Primed cloath,</hi> 5. <hi>Pencils,</hi> 6. <hi>The Stay,</hi> 7. <hi>Colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>The Eaſel</hi> is a Frame made of wood (much like a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100848:68"/>ladder) with ſides flat, and full of holes, to put in two pins to ſet your work upon higher or lower at pleaſure; ſomething broader at bottom than at the top; on the backſide whereof is a ſtay, by which you may ſet the Eaſel more upright or ſloping.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Pallet</hi> is a thin piece of wood, (Peartree or Walnut) a foot long, and about ten inches broad, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like an Egg, at the narroweſt end of which is made an hole, to put in the thumb of the left hand, near to which is cut a notch, that ſo you may hold the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in your hand. <hi>Its uſe is to hold and temper the Colours upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The <hi>Streining frame</hi> is made of wood, to which with nails is faſtned the primed cloath, which is to be painted upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe ought to be of ſeveral ſizes according to the bigneſs of the cloath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Primed cloath</hi> is that which is to be painted upon; and is thus prepared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take good Canvaſe and ſmooth it over with a ſlick-ſtone, ſize it over with ſize, and a little honey, and let it dry; then white it over once with whiting and ſize mixed with a little honey, ſo is the cloath prepared, on which you may draw the picture with a coal, and laſtly lay on the Colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where note, honey keeps it from cracking, peeling or break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Pencils</hi> are of all bigneſſes, from a pin to the bigneſs of a finger, called by ſeveral names, as <hi>Ducks quill fitched</hi> and <hi>pointed; Gooſe quill fitched</hi> and <hi>pointed; Swans quill fitched</hi> and <hi>pointed; Jewelling pencils,</hi> and <hi>briſtle pencils:</hi> ſome in quills, ſome in tinn caſes, and ſome in ſticks.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The <hi>Stay</hi> or <hi>Mol-ſtick,</hi> is a Brazil ſtick (or the like) of a yard long; having at the one end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a little ball of Cotton, fixed hard in a piece of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100848:68"/>of the bigneſs of a cheſtnut; which when you are at work you muſt hold in your left hand; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end which hath the leather ball upon the cloath or frame, you may reſt your right arm upon it, whilſt you are at work.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The Colours are in number ſeven <hi>(ut ſuprà)</hi> to wit, White, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blew, and Brown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of which ſome may be tempered on the pallet at firſt; ſome muſt be ground, and then tempered; and other ſome muſt be burnt, ground, and laſtly tempered.</hi>

                  <hi>Take glew, and boil it well in fair water, till it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and it is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">XI. To make the whiting for the fifth Section of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of the aforeſaid ſize, mix it with whiting ground, and ſo white your boards or cloath (being made ſmooth) dry them, and white them a ſecond or third time; laſtly, ſcrape them ſmooth and draw it over with white Lead tempered with oyl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. To keep the Colours from skinning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oyl colours (if not preſently uſed) will have a skin grow over them, to prevent which, put them into a glaſs, and put the glaſs three or four inches under water, ſo will they neither skin nor dry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII. To cleanſe the Grinding ſtone and Pencils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the grinding ſtone be foul, grind Curriers ſhavings upon it, and then crumbs of bread, ſo will the filth come off: if the pencils be foul, dip the end of them in oyl of Turpentine, and ſqueeze them between your fingers, and they will be very clean.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. UPon the Pallet diſpoſe the ſeveral colours, at a convenient diſtance, that they may not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix; firſt lay on the Vermilion, then the Lake, then the burnt Oker, then the India Red, Pink, Umber, Black and Smalt, each in their order, and lay the white next to your thumb, becauſe it is oftneſt uſed, for with it all ſhadows are to be lightned; and next the white a ſtiff ſort of Lake; thus is the Pallet furniſhed with ſingle colours for a face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now to temper them for ſhadowing various complexions do thus.</hi>

               <p n="6">VI. For a tawny Complexion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The colours are the ſame with the former, but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are different; which muſt be made of burnt Oker and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mber, (which will fit well:) if the ſhadow be not yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low enough, add a little pink to it.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. THere are two manner of ways of painting upon glaſs; the one is for oyl colour, the other for ſuch colours, as are afterwards to be annealed or burnt on.</p>
               <p n="2">II. To lay oyl colours upon glaſs, you muſt firſt grind them with Gum water once, and afterwards temper it with Spaniſh Turpentine, lay it on and let it dry by the fire, and it is ſmiſhed.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:100848:80"/>
               <p n="3">III. To anneal or burn your glaſs, to make the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours abide, you muſt make a four ſquare brick furnace, eighteen inches broad and deep; lay five or ſix croſs Iron bars on the top of it, and raiſe the furnace eighteen inches above the bars: then laying a plate of Iron over the bars, ſift (through a five) a lay of ſlack'd lime o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the plate, upon which lay a row of glaſs; upon that a bed of lime, and upon that lime, another row of glaſs; thus continue <hi>ſtratum ſuper ſtratum,</hi> till the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace is full.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Lay alſo with every bed of glaſs a piece of glaſs, which you may wipe over with any Colour (theſe are called watches;) and when you think your glaſs is burnt enough, with a pair of plyers take out the firſt and loweſt watch, and lay it on a board, and being cold, try if you can ſcrape off the Colour, if it hold faſt on, take out that row; always letting it abide the fire till the colour will not ſcrape off.</p>

               <p n="3">III. <hi>To make Alom water.</hi> Take Alom eight ounces, ſair water a quart, boil them till the Alom is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>To make ſize.</hi> Take glew, which ſteep all night
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100848:80"/>in water, then melt it over the fire, to ſee that it be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too ſtrong nor too weak: then let a little of it cool; if it be too ſtiff when it is cold, put more water to it, if too weak more glew, uſing it lukewarm.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Liquid Gold.</hi> It is exactly made by the firſt Section of the 21 Chapter of the ſecond Book.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Pencils</hi> are to be of all ſorts both fitch'd and pointed; as alſo a large pencil bruſh to paſt Maps upon Cloth; another to wet the paper with Alom water; a third to ſtarch the face of the picture withal before it be coloured; and a fourth to varniſh withal.</p>
               <p n="7">VII.

               <p n="1">I. <hi>PRinters black.</hi> Vermilion, Roſſet, Verditure, and Orpiment are to be ground, as we have taught at the fifth Section of the 22 Chapter of the fecond Book.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Brazil.</hi> To ſome ground Brazil put ſmall Beer and Vinegar, of each a ſufficient quantity, let it boil gently a good while, then put therein Alom in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to heighten the Colour, and ſome gum Arabick to bind it; boil it till it taſte ſtrong on the tongue, and make a good red.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Logwood,</hi> Ground Logwood boiled as Brazil,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100848:81"/>makes a very fair tranſparent Purple Colour.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Cochenele.</hi> Steeped as Brazil was boiled, makes a fair tranſparent purple: as thus, take Cochenele and put it into the ſtrongeſt Sope lees to ſteep, and it will be a fair purple, which you may lighten or deepen at pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Madder.</hi> Take Madder four drachms, ground Brazil one ounce, Rain water a quart; boil away a third part: then add Alom half an ounce, boil it to a pint; then gum Arabick one ounce, which boil till it is diſſolved, cool it ſtirring it often, and ſtrain it for uſe. It is a good ſcarlet die for Leather.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Verdigrieſe.</hi> Take Verdigrieſe ground finely one ounce, put to it a good quantity of common varniſh, and ſo much oyl of Turpentine, as will make it thin enough to work withal; it is a good green. And Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrieſe, Alom, of each one Drachm, Logwood three Drachms, boiled in Vinegar, make a good Murry.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Gambogia.</hi> Diſſolve it in fair ſpring water, and it will make a beautiful and tranſparent yellow: if you would have it ſtronger, diſſolve ſome Alom therein: it is good for Silk, Linnen, white Leather, Parchment, Vellom, Paper, Quills, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>To make Verdigriefe and Ceruſe according to Glauber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe colours are made with Vinegar in earthen pots ſet into hot horſe dung: but if you diſſolve your Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus or Saturn with ſpirit of Nitre, and precipitate your Venus with a lye made of Salt of Tartar, and your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with Salt water, edulcorating and drying them; the Venus will yield an excellent Verdigrieſe, which will not corrode other colours as the common Verdigrieſe doth; and the Saturn yields a Ceruſe whiter and purer than the ordinary: much better for Painting or Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery.</p>

               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Yellow Fuſtick benry.</hi> Boil it in water or ſleep them in Alom water, it makes a good yellow for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>Turnſole.</hi> Put it into ſharp. Vinegar over a gentle fire, till the Vinegar boil, and is coloured; then take out the Turnſole and ſqueeze it into the Vinegar, in which diſſolve a little gum Arabick; it ſhadows very well on a Carnation or yellow.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>Litmos.</hi> Cut it into ſmall pieces, and ſteep it a day or two in weak gum Lake water, and you will have a pure blew water to waſh with.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>Flory Blew.</hi> Grind it with Glair of Eggs, if then you add a little Roſſet it makes a light Violet Blew; mixed with White and Red Lead, it makes a Crane feather Colour.</p>

               <p n="3">III.

               <p n="14">XIV. A few Grains of <hi>Cochenele</hi> being mixed with the <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Quicklime in a due proportion, makes a fading purple colour, of the greateſt glory imaginable in the world.</p>

               <p n="19">XIX. Tincture of <hi>Cochenele,</hi> diluted never ſo much with fair water, will never yield a yellow colour: a

               <p n="21">XXI.

               <p n="22">XXII. A high Infuſion of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſpirit of Urine, gives ſo deep a blew, as to make the liquor <hi>opacous:</hi> which after a day or two vaniſhes, and leaves the liquor of a <hi>bright amber colour.</hi>

               <p n="24">XXIV. Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> will turn ſyrup of Violets to a lovely green.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Caſt your Lead ſeparated from its droſs into a veſſel, and when it begins to cool, thruſt in the point of a ſtick, which take out again and caſt in the Argent Vive, and it will congeal: then beat it in a mortar, and do ſo often; when it is hard, melt it often, and put it into fair water, doing it ſo long till it is hard enough, and may be hammered.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>To tinge Quick-ſilver of the colour of gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Break it into ſmall pieces (being hardned) which put into a crucible, with the powder of <hi>Cadmia, ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſuper ſtratum,</hi> mixed with pomegranate peels, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick (beaten fine) and Raiſons; cover the crucible and lute it well, dry it well; and then ſet it on a fire for ſix or ſeven hours, that it may be red hot; then blow it with bellows till it run, which then let cool whileſt covered with coles, and it will have the colour of gold.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>To fix Quick-ſilver being hardned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is done with fine powder of Cryſtal glaſs, laid with the metal <hi>ſtratum ſuper ſtratum</hi> in a crucible covered and luted; heating it all over red hot, and then melting of it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>To make Quick-ſilver malleable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt harden it by the firſt Section, then break the metal into ſmall pieces, and boil it a quarter of an hour in ſharp vinegar: then add a little Sal Armoniack, and digeſt all together for ten or twelve days; then boil all together in a luted crucible, till it is red hot, and by
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100848:92"/>degrees crack: laſtly, hang the Mercury in a pot with brimſtone at bottom to cover it; lute it and ſet it into the fire, that it may grow hot by degrees, and receive the fume of the Sulphur; do thus for a month once a day, and the Mercury will run and be hammered.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Another way of tinging Mercury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take purified Mercury one ounce, <hi>Sulphur</hi> two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> three ounces, let them all ſtand till the water grow clear; diſtill this with its ſediment, and at bottom of the Limbeck: you ſhall find the Mercury hard, and of an exact colour.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>To colour and ſoften Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diſſolve Verdigrieſe in Vinegar, and ſtrain it through a felt, then congeal, and when it begins to wax thick, put to it ſome Sal armoniack, and let it harden a good while, then melt gold with it, and it will heighten the colour and make it ſoft.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>To make Gold and Silver ſofter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Mercury Sublimate, Sal armoniack, of each a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, powder them, melt the gold, and put to it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this powder, and it will be ſoft.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Another way to do the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Vitriol, Verdet, Sal Armoniack, burnt braſs of each half an ounce, mix them with Aqua fortis, let it ſo repoſe in the heat two days, then let it harden, do thus three times with Aqua fortis, and let it dry, make it into powder, to one dram put one ounce of gold three times and it will be ſofter.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Another way to do the ſame in ſilver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Salt-peter, Tartar, Salt, Verdet, boil all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, till the water is conſumed, then put to it U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and let it ſo conſume, and you ſhall have an oyl, which put into melted ſilver will do the ſame.</p>
               <p>Or thus, <hi>Take as many wedges as you have melted, put them one night into a crucible in a furnace, but ſo as they
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100848:93"/>melt not, and they will be ſoft and fair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus, <hi>Take honey, oyl, of each alike, in which quench the Gold or Silver three or four times, and it will be ſofter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus, <hi>Take Maſtich, Frankincenſe, Myrrh, Borax, Vernix, of each alike, all in powder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus, <hi>Quench the Gold or ſilver in water of Sal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, and it will be ſoft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>To tinge ſilver of a golden colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take fine gold, fine ſilver, good braſs, and braſs or copper calcin'd with Sulphur vive, of each alike, melt them down together, and it ſhall appear to be gold of eighteen carets fine.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>Another way to tinge ſilver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Quick-ſilver purged three ounces, leaf gold one ounce, mix them and put them into a glaſs Retort well luted, put it on the fire till it grow hot; then take it off, and add to it Quick-ſilver purged two ounces, <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> one ounce, <hi>Sal Ellebrot</hi> half an ounce, <hi>Borax</hi> two drachms; then ſeal up the glaſs hermetically, and put it into a continuual fire for three days; then take it out, let it cool, open the retort, take out the matter, and powder it very fine: of which powder mix one ounce with ſilver five ounces, and it will tinge it into a good gold colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note, Sal Ellebrot is thus made. Take pure common Salt, Sal Gem, Sal alcaly in powder, of each one ounce, juice of mints four ounces, ſpring water four pound, mingle them, and evaporate. And Quick-ſilver is purged by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing it in ſharp vinegar three or four times and ſtraining it; or by ſubliming it which is better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>To bring ſilver into a calx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is done by amalgamating of it with Quick-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and then ſubliming of it; or by diſſolving it in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and precipitating it with the ſolution of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100848:93"/>ſalt in fair water, and then waſhing it with warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter often to free it from the ſalts: or elſe by mingling the fillings with ſublimed Mercury, and in a retort cauſing the Mercury to aſcend, which will leave at bottom the Calx of ſilver, fit for jewels, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>To blanch Silver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take <hi>Salarmoniack, Roch alom, Alom plumoſum, Sal gem, Argal, Roman Vitriol, of each alike;</hi> powder and mix them, and diſſolve them in fair water, in which boil the ſilver ſo long, till you ſee it wonderful white.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. <hi>To colour ſilver of a Gold colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Salt-peter two pound, Roch Alom five pound, mingle, and diſtil them, keeping the water for uſe. When you uſe it, melt the Silver, and quench it in the ſaid water.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. <hi>To tinge Braſs of a Gold Colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diſſolve burnt braſs in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> (made of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol, Salt-peter, Alom, Verdigrieſe, and Vermilion) and then reduce it again, and it will be much of a gold co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Trough</hi> is a four-ſquare thing about half a foot deep or ſomething more; and its uſe is to hold the Sand.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Of <hi>Sand</hi> there is various ſorts, the chief are Higate Sand, and Tripoll; the which to make fit for the work you muſt order thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it is Higate Sand, you muſt finely ſift it; if Tripoli, you muſt firſt beat it fine, then-ſift it through a fine ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100848:99"/>to either of theſe fine ſands you muſt put of pure fine Bole (an ounce to nine ounces) well beaten, diſſolved in water, and laſtly reduced into fine powder; which powders you muſt moderately moiſten with this Magiſterial water, viz. filterated Brine made of decripitated common Salt: or the ſame, mixed with Glair of Eggs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Flask</hi> is a pair of Oval Irons, containing only ſides to hold the Sand, which muſt be preſſed hard thereinto: and a paſſage or mouth for the metal to run in at.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Skrew is an Iron Preſs, between which the flask is put and preſt, after that it is filled with Sand, and hath received the form or impreſſion to be caſt.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Tripoli</hi> is that of which the ſecond ſort of Sand is made, which here ought to be calcined and beaten into impalpable powder, to ſtrew over the ſandy moulds; firſt that the ſides of the flask may not cleave together when they are full; ſecondly that the thing caſt may have the perfect form and impreſſion, without the leaſt ſcratch or blemiſh imaginable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Medal</hi> or form, is that which is to be impreſſed upon the Sand, whoſe likeneſs we would imitate.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The <hi>Furnace</hi> is that which contains the fire, where the Crucible is put, for the Metal to melt in which is generally melted with Charcoal.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The <hi>Crucibles</hi> are calcining or melting pots, (commonly three-ſquare) made ſo as they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the fire all over, in which the metal is to be melted.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The <hi>Pipe</hi> is a hollow Reed, or piece of Tin, to blow coals and filth out of the Crucible.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The <hi>Tongs</hi> are a crooked Inſtrument to take coals out of the crucible with, as alſo to ſtir and repair the fire; and to take the pot out of the furnace when you go to Caſt.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:100848:99"/>
               <p n="12">XII. The <hi>two Oak plates</hi> are to be ſmooth, and to be put between the flask and the ſides of the skrew, on each ſide.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Pledgets of wool</hi> are to be put between the Oak plates and the ſand to fill up empty ſpaces if there be any.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The <hi>Oyl and Turpentine</hi> is to wet ſome paper or cotton threads, which muſt be ſet on fire, to ſmoak the Impreſſion or Mould (being dry) that the metal may run the better.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The <hi>Hares foot</hi> is to wipe the hollow places in the Mould, if they ſhould be too much filled with ſmoak.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The <hi>Bruſhes</hi> ought to be two, to wit one with thick bar Wire ſtrings; another with Hogs Briſtles, wherewith the work (both before and after caſting) ought to be rubbed and cleanſed.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Place the female part of the flask upon one of the Oak plates; ſo that the middle part, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is joined to the other, may lie downwards.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Then put the cleanſed Medal in the flask upon the Oak plate, in a right line to the mouth of the flask: and if there be two, let them be placed ſo, that there may be a place left in the middle for the melted metal to run in as.</p>

               <p n="5">V. This done, the plegets of wool, or a woolen cloth, muſt be laid upon it, and then the other Oak plate, and then turned up with both hands, the plates being both held cloſe.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Then taking off the upper plate; put upon it the male part of the flask, which fill with ſand in like manner (the Medal being now between) preſſing it down as before, and then with a ruler ſtriking away the ſuperfluous ſand.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Beat Cryſtal to bits, and put them into an Iron ſpoon, cover it and lute it well, and heat it in the fire till it is red hot, which quench in oyl of Tartar: this do ſo often, till they will eaſily beat to powder in a mortar, which will then eaſily melt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is of uſe to counterfeit Jewels with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>To make a Cement for broken Glaſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Glair of Eggs mixed with Quick-lime will join bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pieces of Glaſs together, and all earthen pots, ſo as that they ſhall never be broken in the ſame place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or thus,</hi> Take old liquid Varniſh, and join the pieces with; bind them together and dry them well in the Sun or in an Oven, and they will never unglew again: but put no hot liquor into them then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or thus,</hi> Take White-lead, Red-lead, Quick-lime, Gum ſandrack of each one ounce, mix all with glair of eight eggs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or thus,</hi> Take White-lead, bole, liquid varniſh as much as ſufficeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or thus,</hi> Take White-lead, Lime, glair of Eggs, as much as ſufficeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or thus,</hi> Take fine powder of glaſs, Quick-lime, Liquid varniſh, of each a ſufficient quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or thus,</hi> Take Quick-lime powdered, liquid varniſh, glair of Eggs, of each alike: grind them upon a ſtone: this is a ſtrong glew even for ſtones.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:100848:101"/>

                  <hi>Or thus,</hi> Take Calcined flints and egg-ſhells of each alike, and with whites of Eggs and gum tragacanth or diſſolution of Gum Sandrack make glew, this in few days will be as hard as ſtone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or thus,</hi> Take calcined flints two pound, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime four pound, Linſeed oyl ſo much as may temper the mixture, this is wonderful ſtrong: but with liquid varniſh it would be ſtronger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or thus,</hi> Take fiſh glew, and beat it thin, then ſoak it in water till it is like paſte, make rouls thereof which draw out thin: when you uſe it, diſſolve it in fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter over the fire, letting it ſeeth a while and ſcumming of it, and whileſt it is hot uſe it.

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Original of theſe Arts.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THe Original of the Art of <hi>Painting</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the forms of the things which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; expreſſing the ſame (as <hi>Iſidorus Pelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiota</hi> ſaith) with colours, either hollow or ſwelling; dark or light; hard or ſoft; rough or ſmooth; new or old.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Among all other viſible things, Flowers yield the greateſt variety of Colours; which Painters (as the famous <hi>Pauſias</hi>) have attempted to expreſs; who was the firſt that aſſayed to bring this Art to ſomething of Perfection in that kind.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Amongſt things inviſible, as Thunder, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the like; <hi>Apelles</hi> was the firſt undertaker: the conſideration of theſe almoſt impoſſibilities made <hi>Theophylactus Simocatus</hi> in his ſeven and thirtieth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle ſay; that <hi>Painters undertake to expreſs ſuch things, as nature is not able to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For as</hi> Maximus Tyrius <hi>ſaith, you ſhall not find in haſt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100848:113"/>a body ſo accurately exact, as to compare it with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Statue. And</hi> Proclus <hi>ſaith, if you take a man brought forth by nature, and another made by the Art of Carving; that by nature ſhall not wholly ſeem ſtatelier; becauſe Art doth many things more exactly: to which</hi> Ovid <hi>aſſents, when be ſaith, that</hi> Pygmalion <hi>did carve the ſnow white Image of Ivory with ſuch a happy dexterity, that it was altogether impoſſible that ſuch a woman ſhould be born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Now whereas Nature ſcarcely ever preſents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one thing perfect in beauty (in all its parts) leſt it ſhould be ſaid that ſhe had nothing more to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to others; ſo Artiſts of old choſe out many patterns of beauty, which were abſolutely perfect in ſome of their parts, that by deſigning each part after that pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, which was perfect therein, they might at laſt preſent ſomething perfect in the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore when</hi> Zeuxis <hi>intended an exquiſite pattern of a moſt beautiful woman he ſought not for this perfection in one particular body; but choſe five of the moſt well-favoured-vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius; that be might find in them that perfect beauty, which</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Lucian <hi>ſaith</hi>) <hi>muſt of neceſſity be but one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. And from this manner of Imitation ariſes the skill of deſigning; from whence ſpring the Arts of <hi>Painting, Limning, Waſhing, Caſting,</hi> and all others of that kind.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. This matter of Imitation was proſecuted in the chief things only;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For who ſhould learn to imitate all things in nature? the greater being attained, the leſs will fellow of themſelves; if any ſhall attempt ſo great a burthen, two inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſaith</hi> Quintilian, <hi>will neceſſarily follow, to wit,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſay too much, and yet never to ſay all.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The former Imitation is of things ſeen with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100848:113"/>the eye: there is another, which is the <hi>Idea</hi> of things conceived in the mind, from the continual motion of the Imagination.</p>
               <p>Wherefore as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith (in the third Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the tenth Book of his Inſtitutions of Oratory) <q>We ſhall do well to accuſtom our mind to ſuch a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt conſtancy of Conceiving, as to overcome all other impediments, by the earneſtneſs of our intention: for if we do altogether bend this ſame intention upon things conceived, our mind ſhall never take notice of any thing which the eyes ſee, or the ears hear.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Thoſe therefore which would profit much, muſt take care and pains, to furniſh their minds with all ſorts of uſeful <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Idea's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This treaſury of the mind, ſaith <hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> (Cap. 12. de Anima) is not over-loaden in haſt. If it be once furniſhed, the Artiſt ſhall find upon any ſudden occaſion all things neceſſary, ready at hand; whereas thoſe which are unprovided, ſhall be to ſeek: it is like to the Analytical furniture in <hi>Algebra,</hi> without the knowledge of which no notable thing can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. Although the imagination may be eaſily moved, yet this ſame excellency is not attained in an inſtant: without the ability of expreſſing the conceived Images, all the exerciſe of the Phancy is worth nothing.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The Art of Painting in its Infancy was ſo mean, that the firſt Artiſt was forc'd (as <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſaith <hi>in the tenth Chapter of the tenth Book of his Hiſtory</hi>) in Painting to write, This is an Ox, this is a Horſe, this a dog.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith <hi>(in libro de claris oratoribus)</hi> 
                  <q>there is nothing both invented and finiſhed at a time.</q> And <hi>Arnobius (in libro ſecundo adverſus Gentes)</hi> ſaith, <q>the Arts are not together with our minds brought forth out of the heavenly places; but are all found out
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100848:114"/>here on earth, and in proceſs of time, ſoftned, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and beautified by a continual meditation: Our poor and needy life perceiving ſome caſual things to fall out proſperouſly, whileſt it doth imitate, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, try, ſlip, reform and change, hath out of the ſame aſſiduous reprehenſion, made up ſome ſmall ſciences of Arts, the which it hath afterwards by ſtudy brought to ſome perfection.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="11">XI. The bare learning to imitate is not enough; it is requiſite, that ſince we are not firſt in invention, we ſhould rather ſtudy to out-goe, than to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it were altogether unlawful to add any thing to things formerly invented, or to find out better things, our continual labour (ſaith</hi> Quintilian) <hi>would be good for nothing. It is certain that</hi> Phydias <hi>and</hi> Apelles <hi>have brought many things to light, which their predeceſſors knew nothing of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. It is not enough to do all things with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of <hi>Apelles;</hi> but there is requiſite alſo, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable grace of <hi>Zeuxis;</hi> the indefatigable diligence of <hi>Protogenes;</hi> the witty ſubtlety of <hi>Timanthes;</hi> and the ſtately magnificence of <hi>Nicophanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a very good way to have recourſe to the excellency of variety of great maſters, that ſomething out of the one, and ſomething out of the other, may be as ſo many Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to adorn our works, and ſo many ſteps to lead us on to the door of perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Without doubt then there is ſome perfection of Art to be attained to; and that it is as poſſible that we, or thou, or he, may aſwel attain it, as any body elſe; if we reſolve to ſtrive and take pains, without fainting, or fear of diſpair.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The Art of Painting (ſaith <hi>Soerates</hi>) is the reſemblance of viſible things; and theref ore the Artiſt is to beware that he abuſes not the liberty of his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the ſhapes of monſtrous and prodigious I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100848:114"/>of things not known in nature; but as a true lover of Art, prefer a plain and honeſt work agreeing with nature, before any phantaſtical and conceited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Art is but one only thing: yet there may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Artiſts, excellent in one and the ſame Art, which may almoſt infinitely differ one from another; yet all alike praiſe worthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There is but one Art of Caſting, in which <hi>Myron, Polycletus, Lyſippus,</hi> have been excellent, yet did one very much differ from an other: and in Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing although <hi>Zeuxis, Apelles, Aglaophon,</hi> differ very much, yet none of them ſeems to lack any thing of Art. <hi>Zeuxis</hi> did ſurpaſs all other Artizans, in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of womens bodies: <hi>Apelles</hi> had a certain inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Grace, proper unto himſelf alone, to which never any other Artificer attained: <hi>Lyſippus</hi> is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in fine and ſubtle workmanſhip: <hi>Polycletus</hi> made excellent ſtatues upon one Leg: <hi>Samius</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in conceiving of Viſions and Phantaſies: <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> in painting of men only: <hi>Polygnotus</hi> moſt rarely expreſſed the affections and paſſions of man: <hi>Antima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> made noble women: <hi>Nicias</hi> excellent in painting of-women, but moſt excellent in four-footed creatures, chiefly dogs: <hi>Calamis</hi> made Chariots drawn with two or four horſes; the horſes were ſo exact, that there was no place left for emulation: <hi>Euphranor</hi> the firſt and moſt excellent in expreſſing the dignity and marks of Heroical perſons: <hi>Areſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> painted wreſtlers: <hi>Serapion</hi> was moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in Scenes: <hi>Pyreicus</hi> (inferiour in the Art of Painting to none) painted nothing but Coblers and Barbers: <hi>Ludi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> the firſt and moſt excellent in painting Landskips: <hi>Apollodorus, Aſelepiodorus, Androbulus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levas,</hi> were the only Painters of Philoſophers, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:100848:115"/>
               <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Simonides</hi> comparing Painting with Poeſie ſaith, that Picture is a ſilent Poeſie; and Poeſie is a ſpeaking Picture.</p>
               <p>Upon the occaſion of thoſe words, <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, <q>The things repreſented by Painters as if they were as yet doing, are propounded by Orators as done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: Painters expreſs in colours and lines, what Poets do in words; the one doth that with the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which the other doth with the Pen.</q> When <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Pacatus</hi> had made a full deſcription of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable end of wicked <hi>Maximus,</hi> he calls upon all the Painters to aſſiſt him. Bring hither, bring hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you pious Poets (ſaith he) the whole care and ſtudy of your tedious nights; ye Artificers alſo deſpiſe the vulgar Arguments of antient fables; theſe, theſe things deſerve better to be drawn by your cunning hands: let the market places and Temples be filled with ſuch ſpectacles; work them out in Ivory; let them live in colours; let them ſtand in Braſs; let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the price of precious ſtones. It doth concern the ſecurity of all ages, that ſuch things might ſeem to have been done; if by chance any one filled with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſires or purpoſes, might drink in Innocence by his eyes, when he ſhall ſee (the horrid and deplorable) monuments of theſe our times. And <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> upon the ſacrificing of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſaith, <q>I often ſaw in a picture the Image of this fact, upon which I could not look without tears, ſo lively did Art put the hiſtory before my eyes.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="17">XVII. It is reported that the <hi>Grecians</hi> were the firſt Painters, and that their colours were (in the infancy thereof) only black and white: But it appears more with reaſon and truth, that the invention thereof ſhould be aſcribed to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who (before the invent on of Letters) ſignified their Conceptions
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100848:115"/>by <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> of Figures, Cyphers, Characters, and Pictures of divers things, as birds, beaſts, inſects, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, trees, plants, &amp;c. And by tradition transferred the ſame to their children.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>So they made the Falcon, to ſignifie diligence and ſwiftneſs: the Bee, a King: its honey, mildneſs: its ſting, juſtice: a Serpent (tail in mouth) the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the year: the Eagle, envy: the earth, a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring beaſt, as an Ox: a Hare, hearing, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. It appears then, that as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were the firſt inventors thereof; ſo the <hi>Greeks</hi> brought it (out of its rudeneſs) to proportion, and the <hi>Romans</hi> at laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned it with Colours: the <hi>Germans</hi> following them, made their works more durable by painting in Oyl; of whom the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> are become mitators.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. About the time of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> this Art began to flouriſh; growing into great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the days of <hi>Alexander</hi> and his ſucceſſors: from thence, through all the ſeries of times, even to this day, it hath received by degrees, ſuch wonderful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements, that it may now be ſaid, it is arrived at perfection.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. Laſtly, that from <hi>Time, Form, Magnitude, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Proportion, Motion, Reſt, Situation, Imagination, Similitude, Diſtance and Light,</hi> in a ſingle and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate conſideration, this Art hath its offence, or being; and at laſt had, by the help of induſtrious and unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried minds, its Original production and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Light is that only thing, without which, all thoſe other things from which this Art ſprings, would be uſeleſs; without which the Art it ſelf cannot be. It is (as <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſaith) the Heavens Off-ſpring; the eldeſt daughter of God; <hi>fiat lux,</hi> the firſt days creation:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100848:116"/>it twinkles in a Star; blazes in a Comet; dawns in a Jewel; diſſembles in a Glow-worm; contracts it ſelf in a ſpark; rages in a flame; is pale in a candle; and dyes in a coal. By it the ſight hath being, and the imagination life, which comprehends the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of all things without ſpace of place; the whole Heavens in their vaſt and full extent, enter at once through the Apple of the eye, without any ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of paſſage: the <hi>Sight</hi> is a ſenſe, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends that, which no other ſenſe is capable of: it judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and diſtinguiſheth between two contraries in an inſtant; it conſiders the excellency and beauty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very object; the ſpangled Canopy of Heaven by night; the wandering cloud by day; the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful form of the rainbow; the glorious matutine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Phaebus;</hi> his meridional exaltation; the golden rays which ſurround him; the mutability of his ſhadows; his Veſpertine ſetting; the lofty tops of mountains; unacceſſible and ridgy rocks; profound valleys; large plains, which ſeem to meet Heaven; green trees and pleaſant groves; delightful hills; ſweet and flowery meadows; pleaſant ſtreams; ſpringing fountains; flowing rivers; ſtately Cities; famous Towers; large bridges; magnificent buildings; fruitful Orchards and Gardens; ſhapes of living Creatures, from the Elephant to the Ant, from the Eagle to the Wren, and from the Whale to the Shrimp; the wonderful form of Inſects; the marching of Armies; the beſieging and ſtorming of Gariſons; the inſolencies of rude people; the flight of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed; the deſolations and depopulations of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Countries; the ſailing of Ships; terrible Sea-fights; great beauty of Colours, together with thouſands of other things; all which it digeſts, and marſhals in ample order, that when occaſion may

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of a Picture in general.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. IN every Picture there are always four principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations: to wit, 1. <hi>Invenſion,</hi> 2. <hi>Proportion,</hi> 3. <hi>Colour, and</hi> 4. <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Invention</hi> muſt be free, and flow from a general knowledge of Antiquities, Hiſtory, Poetical fictions, Geometrical concluſions, and Optical conſiderations; according to its Situation or Aſpect, either near or far off.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And this <hi>Invention</hi> muſt expreſs proper and fit things, agreeing to the Circumſtances of <hi>Time, Place, Matter,</hi> and <hi>Perſon;</hi> and having reſpect to the modes of habits belonging to the Country or People whether <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> or <hi>Modern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Proportion, Analogy,</hi> or <hi>Symmetry</hi> (which you pleaſe) in that which limits each part to its proper big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in reſpect to the whole:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoever differs from this recedes from beauty, and may be called Deformity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. This <hi>Proportion</hi> is called by Artiſts the deſigning lines; which are firſt drawn before the whole is painted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe proportions or lineal deſigns, draughts, and ſcotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, may be called Picture, which being well done, ſhew not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſhape, but alſo the intent: In lines only, we may draw the Proportion of a Black More, and ſuch as ſhall be like him; Now this Skill proceeds from the very higheſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:100848:117"/>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Colour</hi> is that which makes the Picture reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what we deſire to imitate; by mixing of various Colours together.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. In making any thing apparent, it is neceſſary to expreſs its oppoſite or contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So light and ſhadows forward, ſet forth Paintings out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as if you might take hold of them with your hand: blackneſs makes things ſeem farther off, and is uſed in things hollow, as Caves, Wells, &amp;c. the more deep, the more black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Brightneſs exceeds light, ſparkling in ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is uſed in the Glory of Angels; twinkling of Gems, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Gold and Silver veſſels, fires and flames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. In Painting of a man, grace each limb with its proper and lively Colour; the black make ſincerely black; the white, pure, with redneſs intermixt. But to paint purely the exquiſite beauty of a woman, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be well done (except it be by a very ingenious Artiſt indeed) her rare complexion being ſcarcely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be imitated with Colours: <hi>There is none really knows the exact mixture for ſuch a Countenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. Life or Motion is that from whence action or paſſion doth reſult, which in coloured pictures is ſeen with a lively force of Geſture and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To do this it is neceſſary that the Artiſt be well acquainted with the nature, manners, and behaviour of men and women, as in anger, ſadneſs, joy, earneſtneſs, idleneſs, love, envy, fear, hope, diſpair, &amp;c. Every diſturbance of the mind alters the Countenance into ſeveral poſtures.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of Painting in General.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THe Art of <hi>Painting</hi> (which is the imitation of nature) conſiſts in three things, to wit, <hi>Deſign, Proportion</hi> and <hi>Colour:</hi> all which are expreſt in three ſorts of Painting, viz. <hi>Landskip, Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Landskip</hi> or perſpective, wonderfully reſpects freedom and liberty, to draw even what you pleaſe. <hi>Hiſtory</hi> reſpects proportion and figure: <hi>Life</hi> reſpects colour: In each of which there is a neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of all the other.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The work of the Painter is to expreſs the exact imitation of natural things; wherein you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the excellencies and beauties of the piece, but to refuſe its vices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For a piece of Painting may in ſome part want Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, Boldneſs, Subilety, Grace, Magnificence, &amp;c. while it is ſufficiently in other parts excellent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are not ſo much to imitate Ornaments, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the inward power and ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. In <hi>Imitation,</hi> always be ſure to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and patterns of the beſt maſters; leſt evil preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents beget in you an evil habit.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The <hi>force</hi> of <hi>Imitation</hi> reſides in the fancy or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, where we conceive (what we have ſeen) the form or <hi>Idaea</hi> of that, or thoſe things which we would repreſent in lines and colours.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. This <hi>Fancy</hi> or <hi>Imagination</hi> is ſtrengthned, by lodging therein all variety of viſible rarities; as 1. forms made by light and darkneſs; ſuch as are to be ſeen in Summer in the clouds, near Sun-ſetting (which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100848:120"/>vaniſh before they can be imitated:) 2. Forms made by proximity or diſtance of place, ſuch as are Trees, Woods, Buildings, appearing perfect being near, or confuſed in their parts being far off: 3. Forms of dreams, of which (whether ſleeping or waking) the fancy muſt be fully poſſeſt.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Where <hi>Deſign</hi> is required; you muſt fancy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very circumſtance of the matter in hand, that in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, with a nimble hand, you may depict the ſame with livelineſs and Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Slow performance cauſes a perturbation in the fancy, cooling of the mind, and deſtruction of that paſſion which ſhould carry the work on: but quickneſs and diligence brings forth things even excellent indeed: Care, Induſtry and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe are the props, ſupporters and upholders of Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Be ſure you dwell not too long upon deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: alter not what is well, left for want of exquiſite judgement you make it worſe: and if in deſigning you want that ability to follow the quickneſs of fancy, ſubmit to a willing negligence; a careleſs operation adds ſometimes ſuch a ſingular grace, as by too much curioſity would have been totally loſt; then by review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is done, make <hi>a regular connexion of all the</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea's <hi>conceived in your mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. With <hi>Apelles</hi> amend thoſe things which others juſtly find fault with; the reprehenſions of an Artiſt are as demonſtrative rules of experience; and weigh every ones opinion for the advancement of Art.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Laſtly, be ſure your Piece be of a good <hi>Deſign, Hiſtory, or Life;</hi> that the parts be well <hi>diſpoſed;</hi> the Characters of Perſons, <hi>proper;</hi> the form <hi>magnificent;</hi> the colour <hi>lively;</hi> and the ſpirit <hi>bold:</hi> that it may appear to be the work of a nimble fancy, ready memory, clear judgment, and large experience.</p>

               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:100848:122"/>
               <p n="5">V. Lay the ground upon the card or tablet, with a larger pencil than ordinary, free from ſpots, ſcratches of the pencil, or duſt, and as even as poſſible may be; and let the colour be rather thin and wateriſh than too thick, doing it very quick and nimbly with two or three daſhes of the pencil.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. This done prepare your ſhadows in order, by the ſeventh rule of the four and twentieth Chapter of the ſecond Book.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Then draw the out-lines of the face with lake and white mingled together very fine; ſo that if you ſhould miſtake in your firſt draught, you may with a ſtrong ſtroke draw it true, the other line by reaſon of its faintneſs being no hinderance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe lines muſt be truly drawn, ſharp and neat, with the greateſt exactneſs imaginable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Obſerve the moſt remarkable and deep ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, to keep in memory when you go over them with more exactneſs; drawing out alſo (if you ſo pleaſe) the ſhape of that part of the body next adjoining to the face, <hi>viz.</hi> a little beneath the ſhoulders, with a ſtrong and dark colour, which in caſe of miſtake in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may eaſily be altered.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The firſt fitting is to dead colour the face: the ſecond ſitting is the exact colouring and obſervation of the ſeveral ſhadows, graces, beauties or deformities, as they are in nature: the third ſitting is in making ſmooth what was before rough and rude; clothing what was naked, and giving ſtrong and deepning touches to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reſpective ſhadow.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The dead colour is thus made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of the aforeſaid ground (at the third or fourth Section of this Chapter) and mix it with fine red lead, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering it exactly to a dead colour of the cheeks and lips, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great care, that you make it not too deep; which if light, you may do at pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:100848:123"/>
               <p n="11">XI. The face is firſt begun to be coloured in the reds of the cheeks and lips, and ſomewhat ſtrongly in the bottom of the chin (if beardleſs) alſo over, under, and about the eyes with a faint redneſs.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The ear is moſt commonly reddiſh, as alſo ſometimes the roots of the hair.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. The ground being waſh'd over with this reddiſh or dead colour, let the ſhadows be as well bold and ſtrong, as exact and curious.</p>
               <p>A <hi>good picture, if but dead coloured only, and ſeeming near hand very rough, uneven and unpleaſant, yet being boldly and ſtrongly done and ſhadowed, will appear very ſmooth, delicate, and neat if but viewed at a diſtance from the eye. Therefore curioſity and neatneſs of Colour, is not ſo much to be regarded, as bold, lofty, and ſtrong expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what is ſeen in the life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The next thing to be done is the uſe of the faint blews, about the corners and balls of the eyes and temples, which you muſt work out exceeding ſweetly, and faint by degrees.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Alwayes be ſure to make the hard ſhadows fall in the dark ſide of the face, under the noſe, chin, and eye-brows, as the light falls, with ſomewhat ſtrong touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The light ſhadows being done and ſmoothed, work the hair into ſuch forms, curlings, and diſpoſitions as beſt adorn the piece.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt draw it with colours, neatly and to the life; then waſh it roughly as the reſt; and the next time perfect it: fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up the empty places with colour, and the partings thereof with blew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">XVII. And ever remember, when you would have your colours or ſhadows deep, ſtrong, and bold; that you do them by degrees, beginning faintly, and then encreaſing the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:100848:123"/>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Firſt, uſe the former colours in the ſame places again, driving and ſweetning them into one another, that no part may look uneven, or with an edge, or patch of colour, but altogether equally mixt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed, lying ſoft and ſmooth, like ſmoak or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. Secondly, This work being done for an hour or two, lay the ground for behind the picture of blew, or crimſon, like to a ſattin or velvet curtain.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. If blew, let it be done with Biſe well temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſhell: Firſt draw the out lines with the ſame colour, with a ſmall pencil: then with a thin and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh blew waſh over the whole ground with a larger pencil: laſtly, with thicker colour cover the ſame which you before waſh'd, ſwiftly, that it dry not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all be covered, ſo will it lye ſmooth and even.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. If Crimſon, work with Indian lake, in thoſe places where the ſtrong lights, and high reflexions fall: let the light be done with thin and wateriſh lake; the deepning and ſtrong ſhadows, cloſe by the light with thicker colour: this done, the picture will be much changed; the beauty of theſe grounds will much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and dead it.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Let the apparel with ſuitable colours be done only flat with heightning or deepning; and then go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the face again, reducing the ſhadows to ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and neatneſs with a ſharp and curious pencil: draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes; the lines of the eye-lids; redneſs of the noſtrils; ſhadow of the ears; deepneſs of the eye-brows, and thoſe other more remarkable marks of the face: <hi>ſo ſweetning the out-lines of the face (by darkning the ground, above from the light ſide, and below on the dark ſide) that when the work is done, the ground may ſtand as it were at a diſtance from the face behind; and the face may ſeem to ſtand off forward from the ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:100848:124"/>
               <p n="23">XXIII. Then go over the hair, making it light or deep by the life: and in Apparel make the ſeveral folds and ſhadows, and what elſe is to be imitated, as it is in the life it ſelf; lightning the lines with the pureſt white, a little yellow, and ſome blew; and deepning with Ivory black; and heightning with black mixed with a little lake or Indico.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. This done, and the perſon gone, your work being yet rough, by your ſelf poliſh it, and ſtrive to make it ſmooth and pleaſant, filling up the empty places, and ſweetning the ſhadows, which yet lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even and hard.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. The Apparel, hair, and ground being finiſhed, now give ſtrong touches for the rounding of the face; and obſerve whatſoever may conduce to likeneſs and reſemblance, as moles, ſmilings, or glancings of the eyes, motion of the mouth, &amp;c. for which purpoſe, you may find an occaſion of diſcourſe, or cauſe the perſon to be in action, and to look merrily and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. Laſtly conclude, that the eye gives the life; the noſe the favour; the mouth the likeneſs; and the chin the grace.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. In fair coloured drapery, if the lightning be done with fine ſhell gold, it will add a moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſtre, and be a ſingular ornament to your work; and if this gold be mixt with the very ground it ſelf, the apparel will appear much the fairer.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>TO make the Tablet for Landskip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take a piece of Vellom, and ſhare it thin upon a frame, faſtning it with paſt or glew, and paſting it upon a board; and this manner of tablets are altogether uſed in</hi> Italy <hi>for Landskip, and Hiſtory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. If you draw a Land-skip from the life, take your ſtation from the riſe of ground, or top of an hill, where you ſhall have a large Horizon, marking your tablet into three diviſions downwards, from the top to the bottom: then your face being directly oppoſed to the midſt of the finitor, keeping your body fixed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pict what is directly before your eyes, upon your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet, on your middle diviſion, then turning your head (not your body) to the right hand, depict what is there to be ſeen: adjoining it to the former. <hi>In like manner doing by that which is to be ſeen on the left hand, your Landskip will be compleated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Make every thing exact, not only in reſpect of diſtance, proportion and colour; but alſo in reſpect of form, as if there be <hi>Hills, Dales, Rocks, Mountains, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts, Ruines, Aquaeducts, Towns, Cities, Caſtles, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, or whatſoever elſe may preſent it ſelf to view;</hi> making always a fair sky, to be ſeen afar off; letting your light always deſcend from the left hand to the right.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. In beginning your work, firſt begin with a large sky; and if there be any ſhining or reflexion of the Sun, beware you mix no red lead in the purple of the sky, or clouds, but only with lake and white: the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100848:125"/>yellow and whitiſh beams of Sol work with Maſticot and white.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Then with a freſh or clean pencil finiſh the blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh sky, and clouds, with ſmalt only: at the firſt working, dead all the work over, with colours ſuitable to the Air, green meadows, trees, and ground, laying them ſomewhat ſmooth, not very curiouſly, but ſlightly and haſtily; make a large sky, which work down in the Horizon, faintly, but fair; and drawing nearer to the earth, let the remote mountains appear ſweet and miſty, almoſt indiſtinguiſhable, joining with the clouds, and as it were loſt in the Air.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The next ground colour downwards muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in magnitude of reaſon, as nearer the eyes, ſomewhat blewiſh or Sea-green: but drawing towards the firſt ground, let them decline into a reddiſh or popin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jay green: the laſt ground colour, muſt be neareſt the colour of the earth, <hi>viz.</hi> a dark yellow, brown and green; with which, or ſome colour near it, you muſt make your firſt trees; making them, as they come near in diſtance, to encreaſe proportionably in colour and magnitude, with great judgment: the leaves flowing and falling one with another, ſome apparent, others loſt in ſhadow.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Let your Landskip lye low, and as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the eye (which is moſt graceful and natural) with a large and full skie not riſing high, and lifting it ſelf into the top of the piece, as ſome have done.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Be ſure to make your ſhadows fall all one way, <hi>viz.</hi> to make light againſt darkneſs, and darkneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light; thereby extending the proſpect, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to ſhew as afar off; by loſing its force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, by the remoteneſs from the eye.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. In touching the trees, boughs, and branches, put all the dark ſhadows firſt, raiſing the lighter leaves
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100848:125"/>above the darker, by adding Maſticot to the dark green, which may be made with Biſe, Pink and Indico: the uppermoſt of all, expreſt laſt of all, by lightly touching the exteriour edges of ſome of the former leaves, with a little green, Maſticot, and white: the darkeſt ſhadows you may ſet off with ſap green and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Trees and their leaves, Rivers, and Mountains far diſtant, you muſt ſtrive to expreſs with a certain real ſoftneſs and delicateneſs: in making Cataracts, great falls of water, and rocks, you muſt firſt lay a full ground near the colour, then with a ſtronger in the dark places, and ſlight heightning in the light; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking all diſproportions, cracks, ruptures and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repreſentations of infinitely differing matters; the manner whereof is abundantly expreſt, in almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Land-skip.</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>Infants or young children</hi> are to be painted of a ſoft and delicate complexion; the skin and ears of a ruddy and pleaſant colour, almoſt tranſparent; which may be done with white lead, lake, and a little red lead; ſhadowing it thin, faint, and ſoft; letting the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100848:126"/>Cheeks, Lips, Chin, Fingers, Knees and Toes be more ruddy than other parts; making all their Linnen very fine, thin, and tranſparent, or perſpicuous, with ſtrong touches in the thickeſt folds.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Virgins and fair Women</hi> are as curiouſly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd as the former, but their Muſcles are to be more apparent, their ſhape more perfect; and their ſhadows to be of a whitiſh yellow, blewiſh, and in ſome places almoſt purple; but the moſt perfect and exquiſite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is the life, which ought rather to be followed than any thing delivered by rule.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Naked bodyes</hi> are to be painted ſtrong, lively, and accurate; exactly matching the reſpective pairs of Muſcles and Nerves, fixing each Artery in its due and proper place, giving each limb its proper motion form and ſcituation, with its true and natural colour; all which to do well may be the ſtudy and practice of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ones whole life.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Old or aged Bodies</hi> ought to be eminent for exact and curious ſhadows, which may be made of Pink, lake, and Ivory black, which make notable ſhadows, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance like the wrinkles and furrows of the face and hand in extreme old age: let the eyes be dark, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect melancholy, the hair white (or elſe the pate bald) and all the remarks of Antiquity or age be very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and formidable.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But notwithſtanding all the aforegoing rules, the poſture or form of ſtanding, and being either of the whole body, or any of its parts, ought diligently to be obſerved, that the life may be imitated, in which, it only lyes in the breaſt and judgment of the Painter to ſet it off with ſuch various colours, as may beſt bent the reſpective complexion and accidental ſhadows of each accidental poſition or poſture, which are ſometimes more pale, ſometimes more ruddy; ſometimes more faint, ſometimes more lively.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. IN Painting upon Walls, to make it endure the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you muſt grind your colours with Lime wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Milk, or Whey, mixt in ſize colouring pots.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The paſte or plaiſter muſt be made of well waſh'd lime, mixt with fine powder of old rubbiſh ſtones: the lime muſt be ſo often waſh'd, till all its ſalt is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted; and all your work muſt be done, in clear and dry weather.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To make the work endure, ſtrike into the wall ſtumps of headed nails, about five or ſix inches aſunder, and by this means you may preſerve the plaiſter from peeling.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Then with this paſte, plaiſter the wall, a pretty thickneſs, letting it dry: being dry, plaiſter it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, about the thickneſs of half a barley corn, very fine and ſmooth, then your colours being ready prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, work this laſt plaiſtering over, whileſt it is wet, ſo will your Painting unite and join faſt to the plaiſter, and dry together as a perfect compoſt.</p>
               <p n="5">V. In painting be nimble and free, let your work be bold and ſtrong, but be ſure to be exact, for there can be no alteration after the firſt painting; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heighten your paint enough at firſt, you may deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. All earthy colours are beſt, as the Okers, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh white, Spaniſh brown, Terrae Vert, and the like; mineral colours are naught.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, let your pencils and bruſhes be long and ſoft, otherwiſe your work will not be ſmooth; let
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100848:127"/>your colours be full, and flow freely from the pencil or bruſh; and let your deſign be perfect at firſt; for in this, there is no after alteration to be made.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>By this is ſignified the revenge he took, for being expulſed Heaven by his own children; of which thoſe which eſcaped his fury, were only four, <hi>Jupiter, Juno, Plute,</hi> and <hi>Neptune;</hi> by which is ſhadowed forth the four Elements, Fire, Air, Earth, and Water,

               <p n="4">IV. In a temple in <hi>Greece, Fortune</hi> was made in the form of a grave Matron, clothed in a garment agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch years, whoſe countenance ſeemed very ſad; before her was placed the Image of a young Virgin of a beauteous and pleaſant aſpect, holding out her hand
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100848:142"/>to another; behind theſe, the Image of a young child, leaning with one of its arms upon the Matron.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Matron is that Fortune, which is already paſt; the young Virgin, that which now is: and the young child beyond them both, is that which is to come.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> ſaith, that among the people of <hi>Scythia, Fortune</hi> was depicted in the form of a woman without feet, having round about her at her right hand a number of little wings.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Being without feet, ſhews that ſhe never ſtands firm; and the many wings ſhew, that her gifts and favours are no ſooner given, but are preſently loſt, and do as it were fly away again, before they be fully poſſeſſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Alexander Neapolitanus</hi> relateth that in <hi>Greece,</hi> her Image was made wholly of Glaſs; to ſhew that her favours are brittle, and ſubject to ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Cebes</hi> the Philoſopher reſembled <hi>Fortune</hi> unto a Comedy; in which many Actors appear often as Kings and great Monarchs; and preſently after become poor fiſhermen, ſlaves, bond-men, and the like.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Socrates</hi> compared her to a Theatre, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meeting place, where without all order or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance men take their places and ſeats, without reſpect to the dignity of any.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Hereby is ſhewed that ſhe (without reſpect of birth, worth, merit or ſtate,) blindly, unadviſedly, and without any order or reaſon, beſtows felicities, riches and favours.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. In <hi>Egira,</hi> a City of <hi>Achaia, Fortune</hi> was drawn in the ſhape of a beautiful woman, who held in one of her hands a <hi>Cornucopia;</hi> in the other, the boy <hi>Cupid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>By which is ſignified (as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith) that beauty without riches avails nothing: and indeed I
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100848:143"/>may ſay he is doubly fortunate, who in his love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys the fruition of both beauty and riches: but he is happy in the ſuperlative degree, who with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two meets with vertue alſo.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>Giraldus</hi> ſaith that <hi>Fortune</hi> was with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picted riding on a horſe galloping; with which ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe ſeems to paſs inviſible; after whom followeth <hi>Deſtiny</hi> with great wrath and fury, holding in her hand an Iron bow, and aiming to ſtrike Fortune at the heart.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXV. <hi>Of the farther Progreſs of theſe Arts.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>AS God Almighty (who is the Author of all wiſdom) was the firſt inſtitutor hereof, ſo alſo was he the promulgator, by whom theſe Arts have made progreſſion in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly, ſaith <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> Picture is an invention of the Gods; as well for the painted faces of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows adorned with flowers, according to the ſeveral ſeaſons of the year; as for thoſe things, which appear in the sky. What wonderful eloquence is this! that in ſo few words, this Philoſopher ſhould clear ſo great a point. But what ſaith <hi>Gregorius Nyſſenus?</hi> Man, ſaith he, is an earthen ſtatue: and <hi>Suidas in Oratione primâ de Beatitudinibus,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaith, This was the firſt ſtatue, the Image named by God, after which all
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100848:146"/>the art of Carving uſed by men receiveth directions: <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife was another, turned into a durable pillar of Salt, of whom <hi>Prudentius (in Harmartigenia)</hi> ſaith, ſhe waxed ſtiff, being changed into a more brittle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſhe ſtandeth metamorphoſed into ſtone, apt to be melted, keeping her old poſture in that Salt-ſtone Image; her comlineſs, her ornaments, her forehead, her eyes, her hair, her face alſo (looking backward) with her chin gently turned, do retain the unchangeable monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her antient offence: and though ſhe melteth away continually in ſalt ſweat; yet doth the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her ſhape ſuffer no loſs by that fluidity; whole droves of beaſts cannot impare that ſavoury ſtone ſo much, but ſtill there is liquor enough to lick, by which perpetual loſs, the waſted skin is ever renewed. To theſe let us add the pattern of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> ſhewed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> upon mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> The <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> made by the expreſs command of God: the <hi>Pattern of the Temple</hi> (which <hi>David</hi> gave unto <hi>Solomon</hi>) after the form which God made with his own hand: <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s portraict of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with its formal <hi>Siege</hi> upon a tile by expreſs command from God alſo: the <hi>brazen ſtatue</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> erected by the woman healed of the bloody Iſſue, as is mentioned by <hi>Photius,</hi> and <hi>Aſterius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Amaſa,</hi> and other Eccleſiaſtick writers: the <hi>Picture</hi> alſo of our Lord made without hands, as it is related by <hi>Damaſcenus Cedrenus</hi> and others: the <hi>Picture</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a napkin or towel, ſent by our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, unto <hi>Augarus</hi> King of <hi>Edeſſa;</hi> together with many more too tedious here to relate.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>By vertue of this divine hand it was that many Artiſts of old attained to a certain kind of perfection in theſe Arts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will only refer the proof of this to the examples in the 31 of <hi>Exodus</hi> of <hi>Benaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab;</hi> of whom God himſelf witneſſeth, that he called them by name
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100848:146"/>to make the <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> and filled them with his ſpirit, not only to deviſe curious works <hi>in Gold, in Silver, in Braſs, and in Silk;</hi> but alſo gave them skill to teach others the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Nature alſo bath not been idle, but hath acted a maſter piece herein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To paſs by the glory of flowers, the excellent comlineſs of beaſts (as in the ſpots of <hi>Leopards,</hi> tails of <hi>Peacocks</hi> and the like) I will only remark the ſame of a Gem, which <hi>Pyrrbus</hi> (who made war with the <hi>Romant</hi>) had; of which <hi>Pliny in lib.</hi> 37. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. of his natural hiſtory, reports, that it being an <hi>Agath,</hi> had the <hi>nine Muſes</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> holding of a Lute depicted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; the ſpots not by Art, but by nature, being ſo ſpread over the ſtone, that each Muſe had her peculiar mark. <hi>See Gaffaret cap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>The care of Parents in the education of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, was another reaſon of the progreſs hereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grecians, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle in cap.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. of his Politicks, did teach their children the Art of Painting; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Paulus AEmilius</hi> had Sculptors and Painters amongſt the maſters of his children, as well as Philoſophers and Rhetoricians: and <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that by the Authority of <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> this Art hath been ranked among the liberal ſciences, and that only free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born children ſhould learn it. And <hi>Galen</hi> enumerating ſeveral arts as <hi>Phyſick, Rhetorick, Muſick, Geometry, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, Logick, Grammar and knowledge of Law;</hi> add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe, ſaith he, <hi>Carving and Painting.</hi> And as the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were the firſt, that taught their children theſe Arts, ſo alſo they provided betimes for them choice maſters.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Theſe maſters by their carefulneſs and vigilancy, not deceiving thoſe that put their truſt in them, became main pillars of theſe Arts, and propagated them to poſterity; which by the addition of conſiderable gifts and rewards had an honourable eſteem in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:100848:147"/>
               <p>Their care was manifeſt in laying down ſolid prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Art; of which <hi>Quintilian in cap.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 12. of his Inſtitutions of Oratory faith, though vertue may borrow ſome forward fits of nature, yet ſhe muſt attain to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by doctrine. Their vigilancy was ſeen in watching, to apprehend their ſcholars capacities, that they might ſuit themſelves accordingly; as in <hi>Tully</hi>'s inſtance of <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> a ſingular good teacher, who was wont to apply the ſpur to <hi>Ephorus,</hi> but the bridle to <hi>Theopompus:</hi> And their reward was eminent, as <hi>Pliny</hi> noteth in <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his School, out of which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> and many other excellent Painters came, who taught no body under a talent (which is about 175 pound ſterling) thereby the better to maintain the Authority of Art.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Their practice exactly agreed with their precepts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As with <hi>Seneca,</hi> that labour is not loſt, whoſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments agree with Precepts; ſo with <hi>Quintilian,</hi> thoſe examples may ſtand for teſtimonies: And it was the practice of Painters of old, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Polycletus,</hi> who hath not only ſet down in writing the accurate precepts of Art; but alſo that he made a Statue according to the rules of Art contained in thoſe precepts.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Thoſe precepts which they taught their Scholars, they delivered in writing, that they might ever accompany them whereſoever they went.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apelles</hi> gave the precepts of this Art to his diſciple <hi>Perſeus</hi> in writing, as <hi>Polycletus</hi> did to his; beſides an innumerable others now in being too tedious here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite. The like did theſe following, <hi>Adaeus Mitylenaeus, Alcetas, Alexis</hi> the Poet, <hi>Anaſimenes, Antigonus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtodemus Carius, Artimon, Callixenus, Chriſtodorus, Democritus Epheſius, Duris, Eupherion, Euphranor Iſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, Hegeſander Delpbicus, Hippias Eleus, Hypſicrates,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100848:147"/>Iamblichus, Juba</hi> Rex Mauritaniae, <hi>Malchus Bizantius, Melanthius, Menaechmus, Menetor, Pamphilus, Polemon, Porphyrius, Praxiteles, Protogenes, Theophanes, Xenocrates,</hi> and many others, the chief of whoſe works are now loſt.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>As Arts came now into eſtimation, ſo at length Laws were eſtabliſhed for their preſervation; and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their prevarication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The beginning of theſe Laws was firſt at <hi>Argos, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, Thebes</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where a workman (ſaith <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi>) is fearfully puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he undertake any charge in the Common wealth, or meddle with any trade but his own: the which Law ſaith <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> did alſo approve of. By means of which Laws it was, that the Artiſts of thoſe nations attained to ſuch a perfection of Art, as we ſhall hereafter relate.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>The fervent deſire, and love of emulation to excel others; the commendable ſimplicity of Art; together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfaction of doing ſomething well, gave a large progreſs towards the advance of Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was nobly ſaid of <hi>Scipio Africanns,</hi> that every magnanimous ſpirit compares himſelf, not only with them that are now alive; but alſo with the famous men of all ages; whereby it appears that great wits are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by the ſting of emulation, driven forwards to great matters; but he that by too much love of his own works, compares himſelf with no body, muſt needs attribute much to his own conceits. Doſt thou deſire the glory of ſwiftneſs? ſaith <hi>Martial</hi> (<hi>in Epigr.</hi> 36. <hi>lib.</hi> 12. ſtrive to out go the <hi>Tyger,</hi> and the light <hi>Oſtrich;</hi> it is no glory at all to <hi>out-run Aſſes.</hi> This <hi>emulation</hi> is the ſource of great wits, whereby our imitation is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſometimes by envy, and ſometimes by admiration, whereby it falls out, that the thing we earneſtly ſeek
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100848:148"/>after, is ſoon brought to ſome height of perfection; which perfection conſiſts in exact imitation, according to the ſimplicity of Art, and not in gaudy appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which adorns the ſhadows much more than ever nature adorned the ſubſtance. This imitation of the life gave the <hi>Artizan</hi> fame; which fame quickened his aſpiring thoughts, adding more fuel to the flames, till ſuch time, as he brought forth a moſt abſolute work, whereby he conceived a joy, content and ſatisfaction, as durable as the work it ſelf, upon which he now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf a happy man, and through a juſt affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his vertues knows himſelf to be lifted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of envy, where he ſtands ſecure of his fame, enjoying in this life (as if he were now conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated unto Eternity) the veneration that is like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him after his death; thus an honeſt <hi>emulation</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi> bringing forth works of general applauſe, procureth unto its author an everlaſting Glory. Now what a comfortable thing is this, to have a fore-feeling of what we hope to attain to?</p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>Another reaſon of the Augmentation of theſe Arts, was the manifold uſes thereof among men, either for good or evil purpoſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in natural Sciences, where words come ſhort, a little picture giveth us the knowledge of beaſts, birds, fiſhes and other forms, as well inanimate as animate; In the <hi>Tacticks,</hi> how ſhould a General know how to ſet his men in array, unleſs he try the caſe by deſign or delineation? ſo in <hi>Architecture</hi> to pourtray platforms af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any faſhion, and to work out the patterns of high and mighty buildings in a ltitle wax, keeping in ſo ſmall an example the exact proportion of the greater ſtructure: In <hi>Geometry</hi> the exactneſs of Lines, Angles, Surfaces and ſolids: In <hi>Botonalogia,</hi> the exact ſhapes of herbs, plants and trees: In <hi>Zoologia,</hi> the ſhapes of all
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100848:148"/>living creatures: In <hi>Anthropologia,</hi> the exact deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of all the parts of mans body both inward and outward: In <hi>Chymia,</hi> the forms of all chymical veſſels and operations: In <hi>the lives of illuſtrions men and Princes,</hi> to expreſs their forms and ſhapes to the life, that age might not prevail againſt them, deſerving thereby (as <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith) the envy of the Gods themſelves: In <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,</hi> to deſcribe in ſmall maps Kingdoms, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and Cities, yea the whole world: In <hi>Policy,</hi> as <hi>Michal</hi> in ſaving her husband <hi>David; Ptolomaeus</hi> in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which he willingly let <hi>Perdiceas</hi> catch from him, ſuppoſing it to have been the body it ſelf, thereby avoiding much blood-ſhed; <hi>Cyrus</hi> his wooden <hi>Perſians</hi> in the Seige of <hi>Sardis,</hi> by which the towns-men being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ghted, yielded the City; <hi>Epaminondas</hi> at <hi>Thebes</hi> by the Image of <hi>Pallas</hi> did wonders; <hi>Amaſis</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> his golden Image made of the Baſin, in which his feet uſed to be waſhed, which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly worſhiped, whereby he brought them to affect him being now a King, who was of an ignoble and baſe parentage; the <hi>wooden Elephants</hi> of <hi>Perſeus</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> with which he wonted his horſes, that they might not be frighted in time of Battel. The Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Temples, Market places and Galleries, places both publick and private: <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s Image in wax, hideous to look too, for twenty three gaping wounds he received, did mightily ſtir up the Romans to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his death. Worthy men which had deſſerved well of the world, had their memories conſerved with their Images; by which all thoſe that aſpire to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to follow their ſteps, are likewiſe filled with hope. The <hi>Athenians</hi> have erected unto <hi>AEſop</hi> of moſt goodly ſtatue, ſaith <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> and have ſet a contemptible ſlave upon an everlaſting baſe, <hi>that all might unde rſtand, bow the way of honour lieth open to every one, and that glory
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100848:149"/>doth not ſo much follow the condition of our birth, as the vertues of our life. Beroſus</hi> excelled in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Athenians</hi> for his divine prognoſtications, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him a Statue with a golden tongue, ſet up in their publick Schools, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Libraries were ſurniſhed alſo with golden, ſilver and braſs Images of ſuch, whoſe immortal fouls did ſpeak in thoſe places. The provocations of vices have alſo augmented the Art; it hath been pleaſing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave <hi>wanten luſts</hi> upon their cups; and to drink in <hi>Ribauldry</hi> and <hi>Abominations,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith in the Proem of this 33 Book.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>The uſe therefore of theſe Arts extending it ſelf ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to all intents both in war and peace, it came to paſs that Artificers were honoured by all ſorts of men; which themſelves perceiving, did ſtill endeavour to encreaſe this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed favour by a daily advance of their skill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Kings they were honoured; for <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whileſt at the Siege of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> came to <hi>Protogenes,</hi> leaving the hope of his Victory to behold an Artificer. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great came alſo to <hi>Apelles</hi> his ſhop, often accompanied with many Princes. It was his will that none but <hi>Polycletus</hi> alone, ſhould caſt his <hi>Statue</hi> in <hi>Braſs,</hi> that none but <hi>Apelles</hi> alone ſhould <hi>paint</hi> him in <hi>colours,</hi> that none but <hi>Pyrgoteles</hi> alone ſhould <hi>engrave</hi> him. The eſtimation of the Artiſts were alſo underſtood from the eſteem and high rates their works were prized at; a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Bularchus,</hi> a Painter, was valued at its weight in gold by <hi>Candaules</hi> King of <hi>Lydia: Ariſtides</hi> was ſo ſingular in his Art, that it is reported of King <hi>Attalus</hi> that he gave an hundred Talents (which is about ſeventeen thouſand and five hundred pounds ſterling) for one of his Pictures. As much had <hi>Polycletus</hi> for one of his. <hi>Apelles</hi> had for painting the picture of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great, three thouſand and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100848:149"/>pounds given him in golden coin. <hi>Cafar</hi> payed to <hi>Timomachus</hi> eighty Talents; (about fourteen thouſand pounds ſterling,) for the Pictures of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Medea.</hi> Many more examples we might produce, but theſe may ſuffice; at length no price was thought equal to their worth; ſo <hi>Nicias</hi> rather than he would ſell his picture called <hi>Necyia</hi> to King <hi>Attalus,</hi> who proffered him ſixty Talents, (worth near eleven thouſand pound ſterling,) beſtowed it as a preſent upon his Countrey.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>Art meeting with ſuch Succeſſes, created a boldneſs in Artificers, to aixempt even the greateſt matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great <hi>Coloſſes</hi> of the antients may ſerve here for an example; <hi>Zeuxis</hi> above all the reſt, hath been admired for his boldneſs: <hi>Euphranor</hi> alſo excelled <hi>Parrhaſius</hi> in this kind, in that the <hi>Theſens</hi> of the one ſo infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the <hi>Theſeus</hi> of the other. So great an excellency of Spirit aroſe in the old Artificers, as not to be daunted by the authority of thoſe who were like to cenſure their works it was agreat mark they aimed at, to avoid a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous ſhame or fear. And this they accompliſhed by taking care, not only to give them content, who muſt of neceſſity be contented with the work, but alſo that they might ſeem admirable unto them which may judge freely without controul. So they heeded to do well in the opinion of accurate and judicious ſpectators, rather than to do that which liked themſelves. And therefore whatſoever is dedicated unto poſterity, and to remain as an example for others, had need be well done, neat, poliſhed, and made according to the true rule and law of Art, for as much as it is likely to come into the hands of skilful Artificers, judicious cenſurers, and ſuch as make a narrow ſcrutiny into every defect. But as it is impoſſible to attain to an excellency, or height of any thing without a beginning, ſo do the firſt things in going on of the work ſeem to be the leaſt; the height
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100848:150"/>of Arts, as of trees, delighteth us very much, ſo do not the roots; yet can there be no height without the roots. And therefore we ſhall find that a frequent and continual exerciſe, as it is moſt laborious, ſo it is moſt profitable; ſeeing <hi>nature doth begin, hope of profit doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and exerciſe doth accompliſh</hi> the thing ſought after. In ſumm; by doing quickly, we ſhall never learn to do well: but by doing well, it is very likely we may learn to do quickly. To this ſpeedy and well doing there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth three things, <hi>viz.</hi> to add, to detract, and to change. To add or detract, requireth leſs labour and judgment; but to depreſs thoſe things that ſwell, to raiſe thoſe things that fink, to tye cloſe thoſe things which are ſcattered, to digeſt things that are without order, to compoſe things that are different, to reſtrain things that are inſolent, requireth double pains: for thoſe things may be condemned, which once did pleaſe, to make way for inventions not yet thought of. Now without doubt, the beſt way for emendation is to lay by the deſign for a time, till it ſeem unto us as new, or anothers invention; leſt our own, like new births, pleaſe us too much.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It was the opinion of <hi>Seneca,</hi> that many would have attained unto wiſdom, if they had not conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wiſe already.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100848:150"/>were gone, he retired himſelf again to mend the work, according to what was liked of the greater part; for he did not think the ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He is the beſt man that can adviſe himſelf what is fit to be done; and he is next in goodneſs, that is content to receive good advice: but he that can neither adviſe himſelf, nor will be directed by the advice of others, is of a very ill nature.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVI. <hi>Of Painting the Face and Skin.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>TWo wayes there be of adorning the Face and Skin, the firſt is, by Painting: the ſecond is, by applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of excellent Coſmeticks, which gives a moſt natural, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and laſting beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt way, which is that of Painting, is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Some may wonder, that we ſhould meddle with ſuch a ſubject as this, in this place; but let ſuch know, the painting of a deformed face, and the licking over of an old, withered, wrinkled and weather-beaten skin, are as proper appendices to a Painter, as the rectification of his errors in a piece of Canvaſe: nor is there any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but that the Artiſt ſhould ſhew his care in the one, as well as his skill in the other, ſince a <hi>ſingle</hi> deformity in the <hi>body</hi> begets a <hi>complication</hi> of miſeries in the <hi>mind,</hi> and an <hi>unity</hi> of <hi>defects,</hi> a <hi>multiplication</hi> of evils. And though ſome think the Poets did not much amiſs, to fancy the Creature to be hacht in <hi>Hell,</hi> by reaſon it brings with it ſuch a torrent of dejections; yet let thoſe darkened Souls (who are ſo much affrighted at its cloudy adumbrations) underſtand, that if it was conceived in <hi>hell,</hi> that <hi>hell</hi> was in the center of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: yet we confeſs, it ſeeks darkneſs, and only ſolaces it ſelf in obſcurity, and duskie ſolitudes. For ſuch whoſe bodies have paſſed the ſtamp with ſome faults, and have miſſed the impreſſions or reflexions of beauty, which might make them delectable in humane ſociety, ever make choice of <hi>darkneſs</hi> as their <hi>chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Deformity</hi> is a diſeaſe eſteemed the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100848:151"/>and its iſſue is a matter of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, chiefly <hi>obſtructions to Ladies Preferment.</hi> Now to prevent this danger, to take away theſe obſtructions, and to deliver you from the embraces of ſo hideous a monſter (which ſome eſteem as a Furie of <hi>Hell</hi>) theſe <hi>Coſmeticks</hi> we have offered upon the <hi>Altar</hi> of your defects; proteſting that the uſe of theſe beautifiers, will make you as fit for the entertainment of Courtiers, as ever you were before for the courtſhip of <hi>Grooms</hi> or <hi>Hoſtlers,</hi> and make your <hi>ruſty skins</hi> and <hi>ill-look'd faces,</hi> to out-ſhine with a radiant luſtre, the moſt ſplendid of all the <hi>Nymphs</hi> of <hi>Diana.</hi> Though you may look ſo much like the Image of death, as that your skins might be taken for your winding ſheets, yet by our directions you may attain ſuch a roſid colour, and ſuch a lively chearfulneſs, as ſhall not only make you look like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures workmanſhip, but alſo put admiration into the beholders, and fix them in a belief, that you are the firſt-fruits of the reſurrection. Thus we teach you <hi>lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid mortals</hi> to retrace the ſteps of youthfulneſs, and to transform the wrinkled hide of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> into the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der skin of the Greateſt of beauties; which then you will dull by the advance of your features, and make all conceited ſhadows of glory, to vaniſh in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. When once your artificial heat ſhall appear, others ſhall ſeem pale with envy for your perfections; and their <hi>natural ruddineſs</hi> ſhall only ſerve them to <hi>bluſh,</hi> to ſee their features clouded by your ſplendor, who will ſeem like brown bread compared with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet, or rather like wooden diſhes upon a ſhelf of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ware, or as another once ſaid, like blubberd jugs in a cupboard of Venice glaſſes, or as earthen piſs-pots in a Goldſmiths ſhop. By this means, your ſparkling Glories ſhall fire <hi>Platonick</hi> Lovers, ſo that none though as cold as <hi>Saturn,</hi> ſhall be able to reſiſt your
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100848:152"/>actuating flames, but ſhall force the ſtouteſt heart, to be a <hi>Sacrifice to love.</hi> If any remain unſcorched, it muſt be only thoſe leaden hearted <hi>Cowards,</hi> who dare not <hi>approach</hi> your flames, for fear of <hi>melting;</hi> or thoſe undeſerving ſoldiers of <hi>Venus</hi> (of a frigid conſtitution) who dare not ſo much as <hi>look</hi> upon your youthful fire, for fear of being burnt to aſhes. But it may chance that ſome <hi>Saint</hi> or another, may condemn your <hi>hearts</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> becauſe you ſtrive to make your <hi>faces good,</hi> and may like your <hi>in-ſide</hi> the <hi>worſe</hi> becauſe your <hi>out-ſide</hi> may look <hi>ſo well;</hi> yet with <hi>Benjamin</hi> refuſe not the many meſſes of Pottage, nor yet the many change of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (although one might well enough ſerve your turn) but receive them from the hands of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> though all the reſt of the Brethren be angry. Avoid not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for want of beauty, when art affords an innocent ſupply, but with <hi>confidence</hi> crucify that evil conſcience, which forbids the uſe of a little oyl to make a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countenance, and the drinking of a little wine to make a merry heart. Borrow our Artificial beautifiers, and become <hi>ſplendid,</hi> that you may be fit to be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hand of ſome metamorphoſed <hi>Hero;</hi> leſt in the garden of <hi>Deformities,</hi> growing <hi>green</hi> with <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> you ſhould be taken for <hi>thiſtles,</hi> and ſo crop'd by <hi>Aſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>To cleanſe the face and skin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before any thing be uſed to paint, or make the skin beautiful, it muſt be made very clean thus: firſt waſh with warm water, and ſweet ſcented waſh-balls very well; then rub the face with a cloth, and waſh well with water in which Wheat-bran is boiled; ſo is the skin prepared.</p>
               <p>Or thus, Take <hi>Sublimate</hi> one ounce, glair of ſix eggs, boil them in a glaſs veſſel, till they grow thick; then preſs out the water, with which waſh the skin.</p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:100848:152"/>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>To make a white Fucus or Paint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Talk and powder it, by beating of it in a hot mortar, to the powdred Talk add diſtilled Vinegar, boil it at a gentle fire in a wide glaſs, let the fat froth that ſwims at top, be taken off with a ſpoon; then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate the vinegar, and mix the remaining cream with flegm of common Salt, or a little <hi>Pomatum,</hi> with which waſh or anoint the face, and it will beautify it much.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Another very excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Crude Talk in powder one ounce, oil of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire two ounces, digeſt till the oil is white; it is a noble <hi>Fucus</hi> for Ladies faces.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>To make the aforeſaid oyl of Camphire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Camphire four ounces, Bole twelve ounces, make them into balls and dry them in the Sun, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill them in ſand in a glaſs retort, into a receiver that hath diſtilled rain water therein: firſt there will come forth a white matter, which melts in the Alembick, and falls into the receiver, then a clearer water; and at laſt with a ſtronger fire, the oil we ſpeak of, ſweet ſcented, which rectified with ſpirit of wine will be yellow as Gold.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Another excellent Fucus made of Pearl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diſſolve Pearl in diſtilled Vinegar; precipitate with oyl of <hi>Sulphur per Campanum;</hi> then ſweeten and digeſt with ſpirit of wine; abſtract the ſpirit, and you have a magiſterial <hi>Fucus</hi> will melt like butter.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>To make the beſt Fucus or Paint as yet known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Venetian Talk, cleave it into ſlices, digeſt it in the heat of the Sun, or of a horſe-dunghil for a month, with diſtilled vinegar, made of Spaniſh wine, adding every day new diſtilled Vinegar to the former, till the Vinegar be mucilaginous; which then diſtill by a luted retort and a large receiver with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100848:153"/>fire. Firſt there comes forth the Vinegar; then a white oil, which ſeparate. After you have cleanſed the skin by the ſecond Section, then firſt waſh with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, after anoint with the oil: if the face be firſt well waſh'd from all impurity, this one anointing may hold for a month without fading. <hi>This Coſmetick if rightly prepared, is worth about five pound an ounce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>An excellent Fucus made of a Bulls gall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take Bulls galls dryed in the Sun, whoſe tincture extract with ſpirit of wine, with which beſmear the face, (being cleanſed by the ſecond Section) leaving it on for three or four days, without going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or expoſing the skin to the air: at the end of the time cleanſe the face by the ſecond Section: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to a miracle, the skin of the face and neck is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered moſt gratefully white, ſoft, delicate and amiable. This is the <hi>Spaniſh Fucus</hi> which ſeveral Ladies now uſe.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>To make an excellent red Fucus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Make a decoction of red Sanders in double diſtilled vinegar, adding a little Alom, with a few grains of Musk, Amber-grieſe, or of ſome ſweet Spices, and you will have a perfect red <hi>Fucus</hi> for the face.</p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>Another very excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take juice of Clove-gilliflowers, with which mix a little juice of Limons: with this paint your face, and you ſhall have a pleaſing red colour.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>To do the ſame another away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Make a ſtrong infuſion of Clove-gilliflowers in recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſpirit of wine, adding a few drops of oil of Vitriol; or inſtead thereof a little Alom, and the juice of a Citron or Limon; ſo ſhall you have an excellent colour to beautifie the face with.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. A <hi>Fueus or Paint not eaſie to be diſcovered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take ſeeds of Cardamoms or grains of Paradiſe, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebs, Cloves, and raſpings of Brazil, which infuſe in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100848:153"/>rectified ſpirit of wine for ten days, over a gentle heat; then ſeparate the ſpirit: this is ſo perfect a Fucus, that it may deceive any man, for this clear water gives a freſh, red, and lovely colour which will laſt long.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. A <hi>Fucus or Coſmetick of river Crabs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Takes of the fleſh which remains in the extremities of the great claws of river Crabs (being boiled) a ſufficient quantity, which dry gently, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a deep tincture with rectified ſpirit of wine; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate part of the <hi>menſtruum,</hi> till the tincture have a good thickneſs or body; with which (the skin being cleanſed) anoint the cheeks firſt, applying over it ſome other albifying Coſmetick.</p>

               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>This wonderfully whitens and beautifies the skin, and takes away ſpots and freckles from the face: but you muſt not leave the liquor long on, but waſh it off with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of wheat bran, that it corrode not the skin.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. THe little Nut which the Arabians call <hi>Ben,</hi> is the ſame which the Latins call <hi>Nux <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentaria;</hi> and the Greeks <hi>Balanos Myrepſta;</hi> out of which is taken an Oil, of great uſe in the Art of Perfuming.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>To make the Oil of</hi> Ben. Blanch the Nuts, and beat them very carefully in a mortar, and ſprinkle them with wine, put them into an earthen or Iron Pan, and heat them hot, then put them into a linnen cloth, and preſs them in an Almond preſs; this work repeat, till all the Oil is extracted, ſo have you Oil of <hi>Ben</hi> by expreſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In like manner you may expreſs the Oil out of Citron ſeeds, incomparable for this purpoſe, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the ſcent out of Musk, Civit, Amber and the like, becauſe it will not quickly grow rank, yet Oil of the <hi>Nut Ben</hi> is much better.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Ben</hi> hath two properties; the one is, that having no ſcent or odour of it ſelf, it alters, changes or diminiſhes the ſcent of any Perfume put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: the other is that it is of a long continuance, ſo that it ſcarcely ever changeth, corrupts or putrifies, as other Oils do.</p>
               <p n="5">V. To make a Perfume thereof, put the Musk, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, &amp;c. in fine powder thereinto, which keep in a glaſs bottle very cloſe ſtopped, for a month or more, then uſe it.</p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:100848:162"/>
               <p n="6">VI. Or thus, Blanch your Nuts, and bruiſe them, (Almonds may do though not ſo good) and lay them between two rows of Flowers, ſuppoſe Roſes, <hi>Jaſemin,</hi> &amp;c. or other Perfumes; when the Flowers have loſt their ſcent and fade, remove them, adding freſh ones; which repeat ſo long as the Flowers are in ſeaſon; then ſqueez out the oil, and it will be moſt odoriferous.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, by this laſt you may draw a ſweet ſcent out of thoſe Flowers, out of which you cannot diſtil any ſweet water.</p>

               <p n="1">I. <hi>THe firſt Way.</hi> Diſſolve mother of Pearl in ſpirit of Vinegar, then precipitate it with oil of Sulphur <hi>per Campanum</hi> (not with <hi>Oleum Tartari,</hi> for that takes away the ſplendor) which adds a luſtre to it; dry the precipitate, and mix it with whites of eggs; of which maſs you may make Pearls, of what largeneſs you pleaſe, which before they be dry, bore through with a ſilver Wire, ſo will you have pearls ſcarcely to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned from thoſe which are truly natural.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>The ſecond way.</hi> Take Chalk, put it into the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100848:175"/>fire, letting it lye till it breaks; grind it impalpable, and mix it with whites of eggs, of which form pearls, boring them as aforeſaid; dry them, then wet and cover them with leaf ſilver.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>The third way.</hi> Take prepared Crabs eyes, ground into impalpable powder, and with glair make Pearls; which bore, as aforeſaid; dry them, and boil them in Cows milk; then in the ſhade (free from duſt) dry them well; they will pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>The fourth Way.</hi> Take potters earth, and make them of what form you pleaſe; dry them in the Sun, or in the gentle heat of a furnace; then wet them with glair of eggs, lightly coloured with Bole armoniack, and cover them with leaves of filver, being firſt wet with water: when they are dry, poliſh them with a tooth, and they will be Oriental. Then take bits of Parchment, and waſh them in warm water, till the water grows ſomewhat thick, boil and ſtrain it, and uſe it warm: then faſten each pearl through its hole up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a fine piece of wire, and plunge them into the water of Parchment, taking them out again; then turn them round, that the glewy liquor may equally cover them: thus the ſilver whiteneſs will the better ſhine through, ſo that the pearls will ſeem to be truly natural, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared, will rather exceed.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>The fifth Way.</hi> Calcine Muſcle and ſnail ſhells in a Crucible, till they are very white, even as ſnow; with glair make Pearls, which bore by the firſt Section; dry them in the Sun; dip them in red wine, dry them again, and they will be fair.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>The ſixth Way.</hi> Take <hi>Sublimate</hi> two ounces, <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> one ounce, mix them, and ſublime them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you will have a ſublimate not inferiour to the beſt orient Pearls in the world, of which with glair, you may form what you pleaſe.</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:100848:175"/>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>The ſeventh Way.</hi> Take any of the aforeſaid particulars, and mix them (inſtead of glair) with ground Varniſh, (made of gum Animae, and the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cool</hi> of wine) of which make pearls; theſe will in all reſpects be like the natural; for theſe will no more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in water, than the truly natural; which all thoſe that are made of glair of eggs are unavoidably ſubject to.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>The eighth Way.</hi> After diſſolution, precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, edulcoration, ſiccation and formation, put the pearls into a loaf of bread, and bake it in the Oven with other bread, ſo long till the loaf is much burnt, then take them out, and waſh them, firſt in good juice of Limons, then in clear Spring water; and they will be as fair as the truly natural. Or after baking, give them to pidgeons to eat, keeping them cloſe up, and in the dung you will find the pearl exceeding fair: where note, you muſt give the pidgeons nothing to eat in three days time.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>The ninth Way.</hi> After diſſolution of ſmall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental pearls in juice of Limons, make the form thereof with clarified honey, moiſtning your hand with <hi>Aqua Mellis;</hi> this done, perfect them as before.</p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>The tenth Way.</hi> Take filtrated juice of Limons, powder of pearl of each ſix ounces, <hi>Talk</hi> one ounce, put them into a glaſs, and ſtop it cloſe, ſet it fifteen days in horſe-dung, and it will be a white paſte; of which form pearl, bore them, and dry them in the Sun; at laſt in paſte of barley meal (<hi>viz.</hi> a barley loaf) four fingers thick, ſtick the pearl, ſo that they may not touch, ſtop the holes, and cover them with paſte; ſet it into an Oven, and bake it with bread, and you will find them hard and clear.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>The eleventh Way.</hi> Having formed them of the matter intended, bored and dryed them, put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100848:176"/>to Quickſilver, ſet over a glowing heat, ſtirring them well about, that the Quickſilver may ſtick to them; then dip them into glair of eggs, upon a glowing heat, and they are done: or being dry, boil them in Linſeed oil, and waſh them in warm water.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>The twelfth Way.</hi> Take pearl three ounces, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Salt one ounce, filtrated juice of Limons, ſo much as will cover them four fingers breadth: let it ſtand ſo long till it be a paſte; the glaſs being very cloſe ſtopped, ſhake all together five or ſix times a day; and when it comes to a paſte put it into a glaſs with ſtrong ſpirit of Vinegar, lute another glaſs over it; digeſt it three weeks in a cool place under the earth, ſo long till all be diſſolved, then mix it with a little oil of eggs, or ſnail water, till it be like pearl in colour; then put this paſte into ſilver moulds, and cloſe them up for eight days; after which take them out, and bore them by the firſt Section, and put them again into the mould for eight days; this done, boil them in a ſilver por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringer with milk; laſtly, dry them upon a plate, in a warm place, where neither wind nor duſt may come, and they will be much fairer than any oriental pearl.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>The thirteenth Way.</hi> After the preparation of the matter in juice of Limons, or <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with clean hands make them into paſte, and waſh them in diſtilled water, which put into edulcorate calx of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and digeſt in Horſe-dung for a month, ſo will they be fair and very oriental.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. <hi>The fourteenth Way.</hi> Diſſolve the matter in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> (which let over-top it a fingers breadth) in a glaſs gourd, till all be incorporated into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which put into ſilver moulds, which have holes through them, and having ſtood one day, bore them through the holes, as they lie in the mould with a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver needle: being quite dry, take them out, put them
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:100848:176"/>into a glaſs cloſe covered in the Sun, till they be quite dry; then put them upon a ſilver wire; and let them lie covered in their own fat (that is, that fatty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which ſwims on the top of the menſtruum in their diſſolution) ſo long till they are very fair, then being ſtrung, put them into a glaſs egg, and let them ſtand nine days in digeſtion, and they will be as fair as the natural.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. <hi>The fifteenth Way.</hi> Take Tobacco-pipe clay, of which form little beads (by the fourteenth Section) dry them in the Sun, and burn them in a potters ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; then cover them with Bole armoniack, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with whites of eggs; being dry, dip them in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lay on leaf ſilver, which dry again, and poliſh them with a tooth: then take clean ſhavings of parchment, cut ſmall, and waſhed well with warm water; boil them in a new pot, with a ſlow fire, till they become ſomewhat thick, ſtrain it, and being warm put in the pearl upon a needle or fine wire, that the hole may not be ſtopped, take them out, turn them round, that the water or glew may not ſettle in one place, dipping them ſo often (drying them every time) till they be thick enough, and they will appear full as fair as the truly natural.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXI. <hi>Of the Conſummation or Perfection of the Art of Painting.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>AS Invention gave way to the advancement of Art; ſo the advancement of the ſame made way for its Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The invention aroſe from the appearance of things natural, conceived in <hi>Idea's,</hi> as we have abundantly
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100848:177"/>ſignified <hi>(in the firſt Chapter of this Book)</hi> the Advance from the bringing of thoſe <hi>Idea's</hi> to light through practice (<hi>by Chap.</hi> 35.) from when aroſe things <hi>very excellent for greatneſs, very good for their uſefulneſs; choice for their novelty, and ſingular for their kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Eaſe of Invention, Plenty of Matter, and Neatneſs of Work, were ſteps by which Art was conſummated. For eaſe of Invention gave Encouragement, Plenty of Matter gave Formation, and Neatneſs gave Delight,</hi> all which ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together, to put ſo much of emulation into the Artificer, to undertake, or endeavour to do thoſe things, which in their kind might never after be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: this indeed was their aim of old, which although the antients of this Art could never attain unto, yet did they make ſuch way, that ſome of their followers have done thoſe things, which never any after them could ever mend, nor themſelves ſcarcely come near. Eaſie invention ſprings out of a great and well rooted fulneſs of learning; by being converſant in all ſorts of ſtudies, having Familiarity with Antiqutities; the knowledge of innumerable hiſtorical and poetical narrations, together with a through acquaintance with all ſuch motions and Idea's of the mind, as are naturally incident unto men: for the whole force of this Art doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally conſiſt in theſe things, nothing bearing a greater ſway in the manifold varieties of <hi>Painting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>It was the opinion of</hi> Pamphilus (<hi>the maſter of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles) <hi>that without the knowledge of Ariſhmetick, Geometry and the Opticks, this Art could not be brought to Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The examples of <hi>Phidias</hi> and <hi>Alcamenes</hi> is pertinently brought here; The <hi>Athenians</hi> intending to ſet up the Image of <hi>Minerva</hi> upon a high pillar, employed thoſe two workmen, purpoſing to chuſe the better of the two; <hi>Alcam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nes</hi> (having no skill in <hi>Geometry</hi> nor the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100848:177"/>
                  <hi>Opticks</hi>) made her wonderful fair to the eye of them that ſaw her near. <hi>Phidias</hi> contrariwiſe (being skilful in all Arts, chiefly the <hi>Opticks</hi>) conſidering that the whole ſhape would change according to the height of the place, made her lips wide open, her noſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of order, and all the reſt accordingly, by a kind of reſupination: the two Images being brought to view, <hi>Phidias</hi> was in great danger to have been ſtoned by the multitude, until at length the Statues were ſet up; where the ſweet and excellent ſtrokes of <hi>Alcamenes</hi> were drowned; and the disfigured, diſtorted hard-favoured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Phidias</hi> his work vaniſhed (and all this by the height of the place;) by which means <hi>Alcamenes</hi> was laughed at, and <hi>Phidias</hi> much more eſteemed. Of like perfection is <hi>Amulius</hi> his <hi>Minerva;</hi> the Image of <hi>June</hi> in the temple of the Syrian goddeſs; the head of <hi>Diana</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted at <hi>Chios,</hi> made by <hi>Bupalus</hi> and <hi>Anthermus; Hercules</hi> in the temple of <hi>Antoma,</hi> &amp;c. An Artificer, ſaith <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in <hi>Proaemio Iconum,</hi> muſt underſtand the nature of a man throughly, to expreſs all his manners, guiſe, behaviour, &amp;c. he muſt diſcern the force in the conſtitution of his cheeks, in the turning of his eyes, in the caſting of his eyebrows; in ſhort, he muſt obſerve all things which may help the judgment; and whoſoever is thus furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will doubtleſs excel, and bring things to perfection; he then may eaſily paint a mad man, an angry man, a penſive man, a joyful man, an earneſt man, a lover, &amp;c. in a word, the perfection of whatſoever may poſſibly be conceived in the mind.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Continual obſervation of exquiſite pieces (whether Artificial or Natural) nimble conceptions, and tranquillity of mind, are great means to bring Art to Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The works of the Antients could never have been ſo exquiſite in the expreſſion of Paſſions, but by theſe means. How perfectly did <hi>Zeuxis</hi> paint the modeſt and chaſt
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:100848:178"/>behaviour of <hi>Penelope; Timomachus</hi> the raging mad fit of <hi>Ajax; Silanion</hi> the frowardneſs of <hi>Apollodorus; Protogenes</hi> the deep penſiveneſs of <hi>Philiſcus; Praxiteles</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings of <hi>Phryne; Parrhaſius</hi> a boy running in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and <hi>Ariſtides</hi> his <hi>Anapauomenos</hi> dying for love of his brother. <hi>Bodius</hi> his Image of <hi>Hercules</hi> is of the ſame nature; <hi>Themiſtius</hi> ſhews us the true Image of feign'd friendſhip; <hi>Agellius</hi> a moſt lively Image of <hi>Juſtice; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> an admirable picture of <hi>Slander;</hi> thouſands of examples more might be drawn out of ancient Authors to approve theſe things, if theſe may be thought not ſufficient.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>This Perfection alſo lyeth in the truth of the matter, the occaſion thereof, and diſcretion to uſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt ancient and famous Painters did make much account of <hi>Truth,</hi> and had rather loſe the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory of their pieces, than to endanger the truth of their ſtory; which indeed is the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a Picture, for as much as <hi>Lucian</hi> ſaith, that nothing can be profitable but what proceeds from truth. <hi>Occaſion</hi> alſo is a great matter; the Picture of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> may here ſerve for an excellent example, whoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of love was ſo clearly expreſſed therein; caſting aſide his brave apparel, Flowers, Leaves, Grapes, &amp;c. Now in repreſenting things truly according to the occaſion, <hi>diſcretion</hi> ought to be your guide; for as in Tragedies, ſo alſo in Pictures all things ought not to be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; let not <hi>Medea</hi> (ſaith <hi>Horace in libro de Arte</hi>) mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her own children in the peſence of all the people; let not the wicked <hi>Atreus</hi> boil humane fleſh openly; there are doubtleſs many things, which had better be left out, though with ſome loſs of the ſtory, than with the loſs of modeſty; wanton, unlawful and filthy luſts (though they may gain the vain title of wit, yet) they diminiſh not only the eſtimation of the workman, but
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:100848:178"/>alſo the excellency of the work, debarring it of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Precepts help Art much, in propounding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the right way; but where they fail, our wits muſt ſupply, by warily conſidering what is decent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; for this Art requireth ſtudious endeavours, aſſiduous exercitations, great experience, deep wiſdom, ready counſel, veracity of mind, diligent obſervations, and great diſcretion.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>To the former add Magnificence, which gives au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to things excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great minded men are moſt of all given to entertain ſtately conceits; therefore an <hi>Artizan</hi> ought to be of a <hi>magnanimous</hi> nature; if not, yet that at leaſt he ought with a determined reſolution to aim at <hi>magnificent</hi> things. So it ſeems that nature did diſpoſe <hi>Nicophanes</hi> to a high ſtrain of invention; <hi>Nicophanes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 35. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) was gallant and neat, ſo that he did paint <hi>Antiquities</hi> for <hi>Eternity,</hi> whereby he was commended for the magnificence of his work, and gravity of his Art. Such <hi>Artificers</hi> therefore as do bring any thing to perfection, muſt be of an exceeding great ſpirit, and entertain upon every occaſion great thoughts, and lofty imaginations; by this means they ſhall gain an everlaſting fame; but this is impoſſible (ſaith <hi>Longinus</hi>) for any who buſie the thoughts and ſtudies of their life about vile and ſlaviſh matters, to bring forth any thing which might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the admiration of ſucceeding ages. If any <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan</hi> be not naturally of ſo great a ſpirit, let him help himſelf by the reading of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Poeſie; Hiſtory</hi> cannot but inſpire a <hi>magnanimous Spirit,</hi> when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to us ſo many rare exploits, and the examples of ſo many great, noble and valiant ſouls, who <hi>throughout all ages,</hi> in the midſt of moſt eminent dangers, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated their vertues and ſpirits not only to thoſe preſent, but <hi>all ſucceeding times. Poeſie</hi> alſo being of a
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100848:179"/>haughty and lofty ſtile, doth much enlarge the mind, and from thence many excellent things are brought: The much admired <hi>Elean Jupiter</hi> which <hi>Phidias</hi> made, himſelf confeſſed to be formed after the Image of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> deſcribed in <hi>Homer.</hi> From the ſame Poet did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> paint the Image of <hi>Diana</hi> among the ſacrificing Virgins. It is not the preſent age, but the ſacred me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of all poſterity, which gives unto us a weighty and durable crown of Glory.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Exact Analogy or proportion, not only advanced Art, but alſo brought it a degree nearer Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> calls it <hi>Symmetrie,</hi> ſome <hi>Analogy,</hi> others <hi>Harmony;</hi> this is the appellation of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> what the Latins called it ſcarcely appears (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith <hi>lib.</hi> 34. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.) yet words equivalent in power thereto are found, as <hi>Congruence, equality,</hi> and <hi>Tully (libro prima de Officiis)</hi> calls it <hi>Agreement</hi> and apt <hi>compoſition; Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, Commodulation; Agellius</hi> calls it a <hi>natural compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; Quintilian</hi> approves the word <hi>Proportion;</hi> by which ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi> beautiful things are perfected: it is one of thoſe things which the moſt High uſed in the fabrication of the world (<hi>Wiſd.</hi> 11.20.) <hi>He hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed all things in meaſure and number and weight.</hi> The firſt giver of <hi>Symmetrie</hi> or <hi>Analogy</hi> was <hi>Parrhaſius, Polycletus,</hi> who was a diligent obſerver thereof; <hi>Aſclepiodorus,</hi> an exact practiſer thereof, whoſe admirer was <hi>Apelles,</hi> who eſteemed it to proceed out of ſome perfections in an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer</hi> ſurpaſſing in Art, and which is moſt apparent in naked and undiſguiſed bodies. <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> exactly obſerved this proportion in the Image of <hi>Jupiter Olympicus</hi> ſitting. The ſame <hi>Phidias,</hi> as <hi>Lucian</hi> reports, could exactly tell upon the firſt fight of a Lions claw, how big a Lion he was to make in proportion to the ſame claw. Lineal Picture is the foundation of all imitation, which if it be done after the true rules
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100848:179"/>of proportion, will lively repreſent the thing delineated: this is a perfection in kind, which yet cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the perfection of a coloured Picture.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>This point of Perfection was further advanced by the exquiſiteneſs of Colouring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The perfection of Colouring ariſeth from a certain right underſtanding of each colour ſeverally, without which it is impoſſible to mix any thing rightly, as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes</hi> ſaith. The <hi>Greeks</hi> (as <hi>Porphyrius</hi>) call this mixtion of colours, <hi>corruption,</hi> which word <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo uſed when he ſaid that <hi>Apollodorus</hi> (who firſt found out the <hi>corruption</hi> or way of ſhadowing in colours) was an <hi>Athenian. Lucian</hi> calls it <hi>confuſion,</hi> where he ſaith that by the Art of Painting, Images were made by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>confuſion</hi> of Colours, as white, black, yellow, red, &amp;c. by which, as <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> ſaith in <hi>Proaemio Iconum,</hi> we know how to imitate the diverſities of looks in a mad man, in a ſad or chearful countenance; the colour of the eye, as brown, gray or black; of the hair, as golden, ruddy, bright, or flaxen; of the cloaths, as cloth, leather, or armour; of places, as chambers, houſes, forreſts, mountains, rivers, fountains, &amp;c. this is done by the accurate mixtion, due application, and convenient ſhadowing, as <hi>Lucian</hi> ſaith in <hi>Zeuxide;</hi> through the obſervation of light, ſhadow, obſcurity and brightneſs, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> will have it. For this cauſe, ſaith <hi>Johannes Glammaticus,</hi> is a white or golden Picture made upon a black ground. <hi>Light</hi> is altogether neceſſary, ſeeing there can be no ſhade without it: light and ſhadow cannot ſubſiſt aſunder, becauſe by the one, the other is apparent; for thoſe things which are enlightned ſeem to ſtick out more, and to meet the eyes of the beholder; thoſe which are ſhaded to be depreſſed. This ſame of light and ſhadow, <hi>Nicias</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> did moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately obſerve; as alſo <hi>Zeuxis, Polygnotus,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phranor,</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:100848:180"/>as <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> ſaith in <hi>libro ſecundo de vita Apllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii, cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Apelles</hi> painted <hi>Alexander</hi> as if he held lightning in his hand; <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> obſerved the ſame in the picture of an Ivory <hi>Venus,</hi> ſo that one would think it an eaſie matter to take hold of her; <hi>Panſias</hi> arrived to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in this, as ſcarcely any after could attain unto, as in the painted Oxe, ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> which he made inimitable. <hi>Obſcurity</hi> or <hi>Darkneſs</hi> is only the duskineſs of a deeper ſhadow, as <hi>brightneſs</hi> is the exaltation of light: if white and black be put upon the ſame ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, the white will ſeem neareſt, the black farther off: this being known, to make a thing ſeem hollow, as a ditch, cave, ciſtern, well, &amp;c. it is coloured with black or brown; and ſo much the blacker, ſo much the deeper it ſeems; extreme black repreſenting a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs depth; but to make it riſe, as the breaſts of a maid, a ſtretched our hand, &amp;c. there is laid round or on each ſide ſo much black or brown, as may make the parts ſeem to ſtick out by reaſon of the adjacent hollowneſs; <hi>brightneſs</hi> is ſometimes uſed for neceſſity, but generally for ornament, (as in the pictures of <hi>Angels, Gems, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, Flame, Flowers, Gold, and the like</hi>) the which is made alwayes with a mixture of light; which mixtion Painters call <hi>Harmoge,</hi> but is nothing elſe ſave an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernible piece of Art, by which the <hi>Artizan</hi> ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly paſſeth from one colour into another, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible diſtinction; this <hi>Harmoge</hi> is moſt perfect in the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> which containing evident variety of Colours, yet leaves them ſo indiſtinguiſhable, as that we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee where they begin, nor yet where they end, as <hi>Boethius</hi> obſerves in <hi>libri quinti de arte muſica capite quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> The laſt and chief perfection of colouring lieth in the out-lines, or extremities of the work, being cut off with ſuch a wonderful ſubtilty and ſweetneſs, as to preſent unto us things we do not ſee, but that we ſhould
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100848:180"/>believe that behind the pictures, there is ſomething more to be ſeen, than can eaſily be diſcerned; thereby ſetting forth, as it were, thoſe things which are really conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this was <hi>Parrhafius</hi> his chief glory; but herein <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> exceeded all others whatſoever, as <hi>Petronius in Satyrico</hi> ſeems to affirm.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>The laſt ſtep of Perfection is the right ordering and diſpoſing of things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This order or diſpoſition muſt be obſerved as well in a picture conſiſting of one figure, as in a picture of many figures. The nature of man, ſaith <hi>Xenophon in Oeconomice,</hi> cannot nameany thing ſo uſeful and fair, as order; a confuſed piece of work cannot deſerve ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; thoſe things only affect us, wherein every part is not only perfect in it ſelf, but alſo well diſpoſed by a natural connexion. It is not enough in a building to bring hair, lime, ſand, wood, ſtones, and other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, unleſs we take care that all this confuſed ſtuff be orderly diſpoſed to the intent. <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf ſeems to be upholden by <hi>Order,</hi> and ſo are all things elſe which are ſubjugated to the ſame Law. Now the way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this true <hi>order of diſpoſition,</hi> is <hi>firſt</hi> to conceive the <hi>Idea</hi> of the hiſtory in the imagination, that the preſence of the things in the mind may ſuggeſt the order of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing

               </p>
               <p>It is not enough, that a Picture is excellent in one or more of the aforeſaid perfections, but the conſummation is, that they all concurr; for if but one be wanting, the whole work is defective. A good invention affects the mind; true proportion draws the eyes; lively motion moves the ſoul; exquiſite colours beguile the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie; and an orderly diſpoſition, wonderfully charms all the ſenſes; if all theſe unite, and center in one piece, how great an excellence and perfection will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? <hi>What a comely Grace?</hi> this <hi>Grace</hi> it is, which in beautiful bodies is the life of beauty, and without which, its greateſt accompliſhments cannot pleaſe the beholder. For it is not ſo much the perfection of Invention, Proportion, Colours, Motion and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition apart, which affect the ſenſes; but <hi>all thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> abſolutely <hi>united,</hi> which brings forth that come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>higheſt Perfection,</hi> which Art aims at, and the Artizan ſtrives after. This <hi>Grace</hi> proceeds not from any rules of Art, but from the excellent ſpirit of the Artificer; it is eaſier attained by obſervation and a good judgment, than learn'd by Precepts, as <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> in his Inſtitutions <hi>lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. learnedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.
